              "[['Donald Trump: (00:00) In the thereafter. Not only his Operation Warp Speed, accelerating the development of a vaccine, we’re also directing a colossal industrial mobilization to ensure its rapid delivery. Nothing’s happened like this since the end of World War II. Instead of the usual sequence of vaccine development, testing and trials, followed by production, our strategy is to conduct these phases simultaneously, so everything goes at one time. We’re not waiting and waiting and waiting. It’s all going at one time. We have a system that has, I think it’s unparalleled, has never been done before, but we suspect it’s going to work and work very well. We’re mass-producing all of the most promising vaccine candidates in advance so that on the day one, that it’s approved, it will be available to the American people immediately and we’ll probably have a lot for a lot of other people throughout the world.',\n",
              "  'Donald Trump: (00:57) The world is suffering from this China virus. Another dimension of Operation Warp Speed, is our focus on therapeutics to treat the virus over 100, including Remdesivir, which is having a tremendous impact. You see that with mortality rates and other things, statistically. Dexamethazone, convalescent plasma and antibody treatments, we have numerous treatments right now that are under study. I think over the next couple of weeks, we may actually have some very positive answers as to that. On July 7th, we announced a $450 million agreement with Regeneron to begin advanced manufacturing of its antibody treatment, which is currently in late stage clinical trials, late stage. Due to the medical advances we’ve already achieved and our increased knowledge in how to treat the virus, the mortality rate for patients over the age of 18 is 85% lower than it was in April.',\n",
              "  'Donald Trump: (01:59) Think of that. 85%, and it’s 25% lower than Europe as a whole. In the middle of April, more than 22% of all deaths in the United States were attributable to the China virus. As the last week, that number has dropped down. As of last week, it’s dropped down to under 7%. To decrease the turnaround times for testing, the first two laboratories have been approved to provide pooled testing. Very important. In other words, samples from multiple patients are processed together. They are pooled. Now, pool testing will reduce turnaround times by more than substantially, more than 50%. Last week, our centers for Medicare and Medicaid services began distributing rapid point of care, diagnostic test instruments to all of the nursing homes in the United States, focusing on the areas of greatest need, which is our elderly and our nursing homes.',\n",
              "  'Donald Trump: (03:00) What we’ve already sent, includes testing instruments to 635 nursing homes for 196,000 rapid point of care tests. It’s a tremendous amount. That’s, you’ll get your response and answer from five to 15 minutes. Over the next three weeks, 1,700 nursing homes will receive an additional 800,000 point of care tests. Think of that. The United States has conducted over 52 million tests. That’s more than all of Europe put together times two. Nobody’s even close, and as countries go, it is as an example, India is up to 11 million tests. We’re going to be very shortly at 55 million tests. India has 1.4 billion people. Through our relentless efforts, ` we’ve completely rebuilt our stockpile, which the previous administration depleted and did not refill. The cupboards were bare. I say it often. In total, we’ve now distributed nearly 100,000,095 masks, 35 million surgical masks, 15 million face yields, and much, much more.',\n",
              "  'Donald Trump: (04:13) In addition to that, ventilators, the most difficult thing of all, we are now building thousands a month and we’ll distribute them. We have all we need in our country, but to other countries that are in desperate need, other countries are having a tremendously difficult time with the virus. Last week, FEMA sent additional personnel protective equipment to over 15,000 nursing homes, including 643,000 pairs of protective eyewear, 7 million masks, 34 million pairs of gloves and 6 million gowns. It’s a lot. Over the weekend, cases in Florida, Texas and Arizona held steady and are now heading down. In Arizona they’re heading very substantially down and rapidly. We’ve been constant and in constant communication with the states and are surging them resources, when requested. They largely had what they needed, but anything they need, we send them immediately. We are totally full. We have everything we need. We get it to the states immediately.',\n",
              "  'Donald Trump: (05:18) We deal with the governors. The relationship with the governors has been very good. These states are not out of the woods, but rigorous compliance with guidelines should allow them to turn the corner, and very, very quickly. We are working with every governor and health commissioner, across the country to bring a complete, individualized analysis to each state, as well as tailored recommendation. States are different. My administration is also closely monitoring the surging caseload in Latin America, which is now the region in the world with the most active reported infections by far. Due to the relative scarcity of testing in Latin America however, the regions reported number of cases is also likely to be dramatically undercut or under-counted. I can say that’s probably true throughout the entire world. We report our cases. Most of the world doesn’t. They either don’t do testing, therefore they have very few cases, even though people are sick or they just don’t report.',\n",
              "  'Donald Trump: (06:20) Given the reality of what we just said, we’re focusing aggressively on the Texas border and countries that we think have to be watched very, very carefully, because you have some very, very highly-infected countries outside of our borders. I’ve spoken with Governor Abbott, terrific gentlemen, and I can report that over 3,300 federal personnel are on the ground in Texas. We’ve given them a tremendous amount of extra help, including doctors, nurses, frontline people. We’ve supplied Texas with more than 2.5 million gloves, 800,000 goggles, 337,000 surgical gowns, 1.8 million surgical masks, 1.36 million N95 respirators and half a million KN90 masks. Beginning this week, Texas hospitals, will receive 500 cases of Remdesivir, which has proven very effective, enough to treat 3,200 patients. In addition to the cross border spread, the stage of the pandemic is being fueled by younger Americans who generally have little risk of being seriously harmed by the disease, but can spread the disease.',\n",
              "  'Donald Trump: (07:42) We need all Americans to be conscious about their actions and to exercise extreme vigilance. I trust all Americans to do the right thing, but we strongly advise everyone to especially, especially focus on maintaining a social distance, maintaining rigorous hygiene, avoid large gatherings and crowded indoor bars and wear masks when appropriate. We also strongly urge citizens to take extra precautions, to shield those at highest risk, which are in most cases, in many cases, the elderly, especially the elderly with medical problems, such as heart or diabetes. But you want to shield them and you want to guard them and you want to protect them from the virus, especially, especially those that are really targeted, almost targeted, you could say, by this horrible, horrible plague, this horrible epidemic pandemic. America will develop a vaccine very soon and we will defeat the virus. We will have it delivered in record time as our visit here demonstrates.',\n",
              "  'Donald Trump: (08:50) I want to thank all of the people and representatives from the great state of North Carolina. Is a great place. It’s a phenomenal place. We’ve had so many great meetings and such a great time. I want to drive into the drive and tenacity of your representatives and your politicians has been incredible. When they call, I’m there. When they call, most of them, many of them are sitting here right now. I will always answer their call. Thank you very much. I appreciate you being here with us and let’s get onto a few questions. Tremendous progress has been made and it’s been made rapidly and it’s been made in areas that nothing like that has taken place before. Please, thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.',\n",
              "  'Speaker 3: (09:41) There’s been a lot of despair when it comes to the virus. Is today’s event about giving Americans hope, a sense of optimism? Is that what you’re trying to do?',\n",
              "  'Donald Trump: (09:53) Well, I think so. But there would be not that same kind of hope if we weren’t doing so well where, before, just before I left the White House in the Oval Office, we had a meeting with our doctors, scientists, some others, and they’re making tremendous progress with respect to therapeutics. I can tell you therapeutically, I think over the next couple of weeks, we’ll have some really very good things to say. We’re just having great answers. It is about that. It’s also the vaccine that we discussed today at even greater length, is just coming along really well. It’s not just one company. It’s many companies have had tremendous progress. That’ll be announced over the next very short period.',\n",
              "  'Speaker 5: (10:35) When do you expect the vaccine to be ready for the Americans to-',\n",
              "  'Donald Trump: (10:35) Well, I heard very positive things, but by the end of the year, we think we’re in very good shape to be doing that. By the end of this year, we’re going to, in terms of the vaccine, I think in terms of therapeutics, even sooner than that. Therapeutics, meaning you go and you give somebody, whether it’s transfusion or shots or whatever it may be, and they heal and they heal quickly. We’ve had tremendous progress. We already have, if you look at Remdesivir and you look at some of the other things, but we’ll have some announcements on that over the next two weeks. Yeah, it is hope, but it’s only hope because we’ve gotten such incredible results, scientifically.',\n",
              "  'Speaker 5: (11:15) One final question.',\n",
              "  'Donald Trump: (11:17) Yeah.',\n",
              "  'Speaker 5: (11:17) You did talk with Russian President, Vladimir Putin. I wanted to ask, if you did bring up the reports of Russia, having [inaudible 00:11:24] on our soldiers, in Afghanistan.',\n",
              "  'Donald Trump: (11:25) We don’t talk about what we discussed, but we had plenty of discussion and I think it was very productive. Please.',\n",
              "  'Speaker 7: (11:32) Larry Kudlow, earlier today said that the V-shape recovery is showing signs of moderating. Do you think given what we’re seeing with the increase in cases that the recovery could be in jeopardy at all, the economic recovery?',\n",
              "  'Donald Trump: (11:43) I don’t think so. I think the recovery has been very strong. We’ve set record job numbers. We’ve set record numbers, whether it’s a pure V or a little bit less than that, I think it’s going to be very good. If therapeutically, we come up with some answers very quickly, which I think we will, then you’re going to have a tremendous recovery, likewise, with the vaccines. If you do that by the end of the year, that’s ahead of schedule, substantially ahead of schedule and it’s ahead of anything that’s ever taken place in terms of vaccines before. I think if those things happen, if just one of those events happen, you’ll go right back into that V and I think you’re probably in the V anyway,. I really do believe a lot of the governors should be opening up states that they’re not opening. We’ll see what happens with them, but a lot will have to do with the fact that therapeutically, I think you’re going to have some great answers, vaccine-wise, likewise. Yeah. Please go ahead. In the back.',\n",
              "  'Zachary Eanes: (12:37) Zachary Eanes, from the Raleigh News and Observer. Now that you’ve canceled the Jacksonville portion of the RNC, do you think Governor Cooper made the right choice to limiting attendance in Charlotte?',\n",
              "  'Donald Trump: (12:48) Well, we’re actually coming to North Carolina as you know. We’re having a very major, I guess that would be the nomination night. That’s a Monday. That’ll be Monday. They’re going to be here and the rest we’ll do in a different form. We could have done it many different ways, but I think we did the right thing and I’m really happy that we’re going to be having a piece of it, at least in a very important piece in North Carolina. Yes, please go ahead.',\n",
              "  'Speaker 9: (13:14) Mr. President, your poll numbers suffered in recent months because of your handling on this pandemic. You’re here now today. What’s your plan going forward to prove to Americans that you’re the right person?',\n",
              "  'Donald Trump: (13:24) I think the poll numbers are very good. The poll numbers we have are very good. We’re leading in North Carolina. We’re leading in Pennsylvania. We’re leading in Arizona, our numbers. We’re leading in Arizona. We’re leading nicely in Florida. I think our poll numbers are very good. We’re leading substantially in Georgia. I mean, we get a lot of suppression polls. We get a lot of fake polls, just like we have fake news. I mean, it’s a terrible thing when you look at it. But I had the same thing four years ago. I was losing everywhere. I had poll numbers where I wasn’t going to win any state. I ended up winning every one of them. The swing States, I wasn’t going to win any of them and I want all of them. I have the same thing this year. This year, they have it even closer.',\n",
              "  'Donald Trump: (14:06) They have it closer, but it’s the same suppression-type polls. We have polls that show me leading in almost every swing state and substantially in other states, by even more than I won in ’16. When you look at Florida as an example, you have thousands of boats out of the ocean, out on the Intercoastal. You look at other states, where likewise, you have thousands of boats and their all waving the Trump sign, Trump/Pence sign, and they’re so proud. Thousands and thousands. You have seen it where you have bikers for Trump with lines that are miles long on highways going along on weekends. I think there’s more spirit now than there’s ever been for my campaign. That includes 2016, where obviously, there was great enthusiasm, great spirit. We had great spirit. I think there’s more today because what we’ve done nobody’s ever done before.',\n",
              "  'Donald Trump: (15:01) Nobody has ever rebuilt the military, cut taxes, the most in our history, created the greatest economy we’ve ever had, cut regulations at a level that nobody’s ever done. All of these different things, the VA, we got VA choice. We got VA, everything for the VA right now. They had a 91% approval rating. In a recent poll, I was just speaking to the secretary. 91% in the VA, that’s never happened before. I think when people see all that we’ve done, even Space Force, we created a force that actual, Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, right? It’s pretty amazing. Coast guard. Now, Space Force. That hasn’t happened in 75 years. What we’ve done, working with some of those warriors over there, by the way, but what we’ve done has never been done. If you look at Alaska with ANWR, perhaps the biggest drilling site in the world. Even Ronald Reagan and Bush and Clinton, everybody wanted to get it done.',\n",
              "  'Donald Trump: (16:03) I got it done. ANWR in Alaska, probably, or possibly the biggest drilling site in the world. Now, what we’ve done has been incredible. Recently, it looked like the energy business was going to be a catastrophe. We were number one in the world, and then we had the pandemic and nobody was using energy. Nobody was driving in automobiles, no gasoline. By the way, gasoline prices for everyone, a very, very low. In many cases, less than $2. That’s pretty incredible. I saved the energy business. I got Russia and I got Saudi Arabia on the phone and they cut way back and we’re now at $40 and plus a barrel. We’re saving tens of millions of jobs in energy. We’re the number one in energy in the world. With all that we’ve done, we made and brought this country to the greatest point in its history.',\n",

We are going to have them again, and everyone knows I’m going to rebuild it. I had to close it up. We saved millions of lives by closing it. If we didn’t close I,. You would have seen numbers that would have been 15 times what you have right now. One death is too much, but it would have been 10 to 15 times, maybe more than that, what you have. We closed this greatest economy ever, far bigger than China, better than China. China was having, by the way, the worst year they had in 67 years. Tariffs, they paid us tens of billions of dollars. The worst year they’ve had. Think of it. In 67 years. We were having the best year we’ve ever had. I had to close it and now we’re reopening it. Next year we’ll be stronger. It’ll be the strongest year so far. It’ll be better even than last year.',\n",

I want to take a few minutes to tell you a little bit about what I think we should be doing right now, and then be happy to take questions. For weeks, we’ve been seeing the warning signs. Numbers don’t lie. Infection rates are now going up in more states than there are going down. More than 125,000 people in the United States have lost their lives, and those numbers and new infections continue to grow at alarming rate. And once again is confronting the simple fact that we won’t be able to solve the economic crisis without a rigorous public health approach. They’re not separable. Despite the administration’s propaganda, that their response should be a cause for celebration, despite President Trump’s requests that we should slow down testing because he thinks it makes him look bad, the COVID-19 is still here, and the daily threat to American health and prosperity is continuing.',\n",
              "  'Joe Biden: (01:10) It didn’t have to be this way. Month after month, as other leaders in other countries took the necessary steps to get the virus under control, Donald Trump failed us. Month after month, as many of us urged him to step up and do his job, he failed us. Just look at the record. In January, I, along with others, sounded the alarm of the coronavirus outbreak. Trump told the country that COVID-19 is, quote, “totally under control,” and then everything will, quote, “work out well.” In February, I warned about the failure to get information that we needed from the Chinese government. What I said was the president should demand Xi produce the evidence. Demand it. Trump said, quote, “We’re in great shape.” Reported China’s president said it was, quote, “doing very well.”',\n",
              "  'Joe Biden: (02:13) In March, I set forth a detailed plan for 500 federally funded testing sites across the country, as well as guaranteed emergency paid leave. Later that month, I called for a full and immediate use of the Defense Production Act. Critical, critical for delivering supplies that were basically needed. Trump accused healthcare workers. How did he respond? He accused health workers of stealing your masks. That’s what he said. “Healthcare workers are stealing the masks. That’s why we don’t have them.”',\n",
              "  'Joe Biden: (02:47) In April, I released a plan to secure the supply chain for personal protective equipment, surge nationwide testing through a pandemic testing board, and launch a nationwide health corp to focus on contact tracing. Trump’s suggestions? Americans should inject disinfectants into their bodies. In May, I condemned the false choice between preserving public health and our economy. I urged the administration to focus on the basic public health measures, like testing, that would enable us to sustain our economic recovery. Trump’s response? He pushed for reopening without regard to safety, and called testing, quote, “frankly, overrated.”',\n",
              "  'Joe Biden: (03:37) This month, I outlined a path to reopen our country safely and sustainably. It provided workers, small businesses, schools, state, local governments, the tools, resources, and guidance that they would need. Trump’s proposal, he set a cutoff date for federal funding of testing sites in several states, and actually went to court to take away healthcare for 22 million people by trying to get rid of Obamacare. And now Donald Trump is in retreat. Remember, back in March, when I called, and he called, we talked about the need to act like we were at war with the virus. He called himself a war time president. Remember when he exhorted the nation to sacrifice together, and quote, ” in the face of this inevitable and invisible enemy”? What happened? Now, it’s almost July, and it seems like our war time president has surrendered, waived the white flag, and left the battlefield.',\n",

We have to meet it as one country, but the president gives no direction, and he pits us against one another. We can’t continue like this. Half recovery, and half getting worse. We can’t continue half wearing masks and half rejecting science. We can’t continue half with a plan and half just hoping for the best. We won’t defeat this virus with a piecemeal approach, lifting restrictions prematurely, increasing the volatility of the crisis, raising the likelihood of needing to reimpose restrictions. Until our science catches up to reality, until we have better treatment for those who become infected, and ultimately are safe, proven, widely available vaccines, we have to continue to do all we can, as the people in the government, to keep our fellow Americans safe and healthy.',\n",

People aren’t waiting in lines for miles and miles long in baking hot cars for drive through nasal swabs for the fun of it. They’re doing it so they can protect themselves, but even more importantly, they know when they have this mask on, they’re protecting others. They’re protecting others.',\n",

Testing is how we see what’s happening in communities all across the country. It’s our eyes on the ground. Without that testing, we’re flying blind. That’s why it’s so important to have reliable access to testing everywhere. We need to increase federal support for testing. That includes doubling the number of drive through testing sites and keep increasing them until there are no more lines. We should create a pandemic testing board to spearhead a nationwide campaign, so every worker, every worker who’s called back to their job can have the confidence that they and their fellow workers are not infected.',\n",

Hundreds, hundreds of healthcare workers have died from COVID-19, and tens of thousands have become infected.

There’s been some progress toward treatment and vaccines, but the administration hasn’t been transparent about how they plan to manufacture enough doses to make sure there’s equitable distribution to scale. I hope they’re doing it now. I called for a while ago, they should be providing $250 million to have a plan now, exactly how they’re going to distribute this, so every American has access when and if the vaccine’s available. They may be doing it, but we have no transparency. Let us see, Mr. President. The White House should report weekly on this progress.

It is essential to coordinating the global response during a pandemic, and the United States should be leading that response as we had in the past.

You all reported to CDC, tried to clear guidelines about what stages of reopening should look like. The administration delayed and scaled back those plans.

How many kids do you have? How many tests? Is that a representative sample? How long is it going to take you to get the test returns? Do you know? Where are you going to find these tests? You don’t have them now. Where are they going to come from? All the information says the test results are coming back slower. You’re going to get them done faster? How?”',\n",

It’s already been called insufficient by your own people, Mr. [inaudible 00:00:25:09], and the unions have threatened to walk, raising many of the issues you’ve raised, from the testing, how fast you can turn it around. They point out that 70,000 kids have no school nurse. I wonder if you can, as Governor, in good conscience approve a plan like that and tell parents, “Hey, send your kids back to school.”',\n",

And I don’t care if a school district says reopen. If they don’t have a good plan for reopening, no kids are going to come and no teachers are going to come, so then you have no reopening, so you’re talking to yourself.',\n",

They’re required. They’re going to be there. By the contract, it says Quest Lab will do the 8,000 tests, the turnaround time will be two days.

Okay, so you have roughly how many parents, 2 to 3 million? You have 2 to 3 million people looking at that plan. They’re going to determine if it’s safe, they’re going to blow the whistle.

You know, you may be aggravating food insecurity, that children can’t eat. You know that you will be aggravating the disparity between wealthier households and poorer households, because remote learning is not an equalizer, it is a separator.

So some plans are in that category. I know they’re talking to districts, many of the districts have said, “Oh, I’ll send more detail,” so we don’t even really have the plans, they sent in a top line, and now they have to send in the actual details. Because the devil is in the details. There’s no top line here. The top line is easy. “I can open the schools, everybody’s going to be safe, I’m going to do testing, I’m going to do cohorting, have a nice day.” But I don’t believe they’ve gotten to the point where they have declined any program.

Before I begin, I want to thank the emergency management personnel throughout the state of Florida. They prepared for Isaias and we did not get the major impact that we were prepared for which is a very good thing, but we did get a good trial run for what will likely be a busy hurricane season. In particular we had the opportunity to beta test the new sheltering strategy which we had to evolve in light of the coronavirus. The state of Florida sent PPE kits and thermometers to all shelters in the storm’s path and arranged for non-congregate sheltering options for people who either had or were suspected of having COVID-19, and it all proved to be very helpful. In Palm Beach for example, we had people show up to a shelter that had tested positive recently or who did not pass the temperature screening and those people redirected to a nearby hotel where they had a safe place to stay until the storm passed. I would just tell Floridians there’s been a lot of activity up to this point in the season. We do anticipate more storms developing so make sure that you have a plan. We’ll hope for the best on this but we absolutely need to be prepared for more storms.',\n",
              "  'Governor DeSantis: (01:54) I’m really glad to be here with Broward Health. We have Gino Santorio, the president/ CEO, we have Josh Lenchus, doctor/chief medical officer, Cheryl Wild, chief nursing officer and Dave Lacknauth, executive director of pharmacy services for Broward Health. They’re going to talk about some of the things that we’ve been working on in conjunction with them. I think that they’ve done a really good job. I think everyone throughout South Florida has done a fantastic job. Frontline healthcare workers in the hospitals in responding to this crisis. We are looking at … I’m going to make an announcement today about testing which I think will be helpful, but we are encouraged by some of the trends we’re seeing. We continue to see a downward trend in visits to the emergency department with people with COVID-like illnesses. We’ve seen a peak in COVID positive patients that are hospitalized statewide happened the third week in July. We’ve continued to see that census decline and I think that that is consistent with what they’ve seen here at Broward Health. Today we reported one of the lowest numbers of tests that we’ve, positive tests that we’ve reported in a long time and we’ve had two days in a row where the positivity has been 9% which we were 15, 16% there for a while.',\n",
              "  'Governor DeSantis: (03:17) These are encouraging trends. Obviously there’s a lot more work to do and one of the reasons why we’re here today is because we want to address the remaining challenges. One is the turnaround time for testing. When we started going to expand testing in May, we thought that if we could get up to 35,000 tests a day that that would really, really be doing well. Remember in March and April, we were doing 7,000, 8,000, 10,000 tests a day. There obviously was a need for more capacity so we worked to do that.',\n",
              "  'Governor DeSantis: (03:50) We have done a lot more than just 35,000. We typically will get in roughly 100,000 test results in a given day. You are also seeing more and more testing throughout the country. The result of that has been turnaround times of a lot of the commercial labs have just been moved to the right more and more. You have longer wait times. Obviously if you’re somebody that is symptomatic and if you don’t get your results back for seven days, that is not helpful. For our asymptomatic test takers, if it takes seven days, then the test is basically useless at that time because even if you were infectious at the minute you tested, by the time you get it back, you probably haven’t been isolating anyways and you’re likely to not be infectious on the backend of that.',\n",
              "  'Governor DeSantis: (04:38) So increasing the times is something that we’re looking to. I asked Jared Moskowitz to make some changes to try to do that, so starting tomorrow, we’re going to have some real positive changes. We’re actually going to convert two of our sites in Miami-Dade County, the Marlins stadium and Hard Rock stadium, to exclusively 15 minute antigen tests. The tests will be for people that have symptoms or for elderly 65 and older. There will still be a lane for the traditional testing for the other asymptomatic people, but that will be the traditional swab with the traditional lab, but for those folks who are older or who are symptomatic or both, you’re going to be able to go in, get the antigen tests, and in 15 minutes, walk out with a result.',\n",
              "  'Governor DeSantis: (05:27) That’s not only good for the test taker and the patient, it’s also good for officials monitoring the trends. When we get tests reported to the state, sometimes those tests were taken 10, 14 days before. Certainly the infections in many cases happened 10 to 14 days before, so if you’re looking at things like the positivity rate or some of these other things, a lot of times that data can be stale. Now we’re going to get every day at these two sites, total of 1,250 tests. We’re going to be able to get realtime data about the percent testing positive, the number of people testing, and so I think it will be really, really good. People want to know and want those results back.',\n",
              "  'Governor DeSantis: (06:11) What every other drive through site throughout the state of Florida, we are going to have symptomatic lanes. This will be people that are experiencing coronavirus symptoms or are 65+ or both and they will be able to self-swab. So they self-swab, we have relationships with certain labs that once we get them the swabs, we usually get a 24-hour turnaround from the time the lab receives it so if we can get it to them as quick as possible, they typically turn it around well. This will be I think very good, so it’s not going to be seven days which is what’s been happening, so hopefully it will be more of a 48 to 72 hour window which I think is a big deal when you’re talking about this and of course there will be a lane for people who are asymptomatic. We’re also going to offer at all these sites antibody testing, and it’s something to think about because think we’ve seen with more of the research and the data that’s come out, particularly over the last few weeks, CDC has now moved to a symptoms based approach for employees going back to work. They’re discouraging needing to get a negative PCR test and I think part of the reason that the antibody test may make sense for people that don’t have symptoms is PCR tests can pick up dead virus CDC says up to 12 weeks but certainly we know people who have tested positive for days and days beyond the 14-day period. That’s not an uncommon thing, so if you’re asymptomatic and you’re testing, we really can’t tell you for sure whether you have live virus once we get those results.',\n",
              "  'Governor DeSantis: (07:50) Now some people may still want to do PCR. It’s going to be there, but the antibody tests, we’ll be able to tell you whether you have the antibodies and whether you have been infected and if you have IGM antibodies, then you likely had a more recent infection. If you have IGG antibodies, likely were infected a little bit further back in the past. So that’s very valuable information for people to know whether they have the antibodies and what we’ve seen is since we opened up antibody testing to the general public, we used to do it for the healthcare workers and for the first responders, we’ve opened it up. We’ve seen the antibody rates increase throughout Florida and some days we’ll 15, 16, 17% of the test takers will be positive for antibodies. Now it’s not scientifically representative because it’s just first come first serve, but I think that there’s a surprising amount of antibodies out there so if folks want to do that, we’re going to be able to do it, but it’s all about lab prioritization, understanding that there is a limited lab capacity for a quick turnaround, and if we can focus on those people who really need the test results the quickest, I think we’re going to be able to improve. So you’re going to have two sites with instant tests and then you’re going to have the other drive through sites with the self',\n",
              "  'Governor DeSantis: (09:03) It’s with instant tests, and then you’re going to have the other drive through sites with the self swab and quicker turnaround at the lab option, which I’m really excited about. We’re also working very closely with all the hospitals throughout the state of Florida. As we look down with this coronavirus crisis, the two things that I think were just so important to get right were doing everything we could to protect the vulnerable, particularly those in longterm care facilities, but then be there to support our frontline healthcare workers and our hospital systems. Remember, when we did the whole flatten the curve in March and April, that was all just to buy time to be able to make sure that the hospital system could cope with the pandemic. And we’ve worked really hard with all the hospitals, as they’ve had needs, we’ve worked really hard to respond with any assistance we can buy.',\n",
              "  'Governor DeSantis: (09:52) So, for example, with this remdesivir which is one of the top therapeutics that doctors are now offering, we’ve gotten 3,500 cases delivered to the state of Florida, which is 143,000 vials. And as hospitals ran low, we had to go to the White House and get the schedule expedited, and be able to get more remdesivir in the hands of our frontline physicians. I think Broward Health, they were going low, and then they got replenished before they ran out and that’s what we were trying to do. We’re also promoting convalescent plasma donations. Hospitals do need this. It’s high demand. It can be an effective treatment. And so we’re going to continue to encourage people throughout the state of Florida to give blood. If you do have the antibodies. If you’ve recovered from an infection to go give the blood.',\n",
              "  'Governor DeSantis: (10:44) That’s one of the reasons having the antibody lanes at these test sites are good, because if you do test positive, you can go get blood and you can help potentially save a life. It’s very, very important. We’re also helping hospitals with personnel. When the pandemic really got hot and heavy in March, the fear that was put out was about running out of hospital beds. That never was really a threat in the state of Florida in March, April, May. But then as we got into and started seeing the prevalence increase admissions, we reached out to hospitals and said, “What do you need? How’s your day bed capacity?” And actually, to a man, they all said the bedroom is great, we just need to make sure should we have enough personnel to staff the beds that we have. And sure enough, that’s been the case.',\n",
              "  'Governor DeSantis: (11:32) We’ve had bed capacity the whole time. Certain areas of the state because of the increased admissions, those frontline workers work extremely, extremely hard, particularly in Dade and Broward. And so we were able to send 1900 medical personnel to hospitals. We have more at my direction that can be deployed. 150 of the personnel are working right here at Broward Health. So these are personnel that we didn’t necessarily use in March and April, May, and the beginning of June, but we had the arrangements in place so that if we needed to do it, we could do it. And I think that that’s been a huge, huge source of help. I mean, the amount of just their lives that they’ve had the juggle, if you’re a frontline healthcare worker throughout the whole time has been tough, but particularly once we saw the increase in prevalence at the end of June throughout July, it’s been very, very difficult.',\n",
              "  'Governor DeSantis: (12:32) And so to be able to provide some level of support there, I think that that’s a very good use of resources and I’m glad we were able to do it. And finally, I think we’re supporting the hospitals, protecting the vulnerable. We have now established 23 COVID exclusive nursing facilities throughout the state. That’s over 1500 beds. And in Broward, we have three COVID exclusive facilities throughout the state or throughout the county with a total of nearly 175 beds. And what that allows you to do; one, it allows you to limit an outbreak in a nursing home. If someone tests positive, they can be safely transferred to a COVID only physical. It also allows a hospital, if they have a longterm care resident who’s medically stable, they know they can’t discharge a sick patient back to the new nursing home because that would obviously create risk of spread, but they can discharge to a COVID exclusive facility. So it helps prevent outbreaks in nursing homes or limit outbreaks in nursing homes and then it also helps the hospitals be able to manage their beds. And if they have patients in there who don’t require hospitalization, if it is an infected nursing home resident, there’s a safe place to transfer where you’re not going to run the risk of furthering the spread. So we really appreciate the facilities here in Broward stepping up to do this. And the hospitals, I think, have worked really well with our secretary, Mary Mayhew. And I think it’s really been successful. We have 1500 beds, almost. There are over 1500, but we have probably hundreds of more that are going to be online. So I want to thank all the healthcare workers throughout the state that have been working tirelessly to support your fellow Floridians in a very difficult time. We appreciate the sacrifice, we’re going to continue to support.',\n",
              "  'Governor DeSantis: (14:22) And remember, there are certain things that all Floridians can do, look out for our vulnerable population, make sure you’re exercising good hygiene, exercising appropriate physical distancing, such as avoiding crowded spaces, closed areas and close contact, and then wearing a facial cover, particularly, if you can’t maintain that six footed difference. Floridians have really stepped up to the plate and done a great job. As I said, got a lot of work to do. Trends are a lot better today than they were a month ago. So we want to build on that success and if we do it with one goal as one Florida, I’m confident we’re going to be able to get that done. So it’s an honor for me to be able to introduce our, CEO Gino Santorio from Broward Health. So, Gino.',\n",
              "  'Gino Santorio: (15:12) Thank you, Governor DeSantis for your continued support and not just Broward Health, South Florida, and the state of Florida in general. It has been a challenging summer, but it is very pleasing to report a reduction in the number of hospitalization going on over two weeks here in South Florida, as well as at Broward Health. Today across our health system and our four hospitals, we have 198 COVID positive patients, which is a significant decline from what we’ve seen in the last couple of weeks. Notably, our ICU numbers and vented numbers are also performing better than anticipated in the projections. That’s a very positive indicator with our ability to treat and get these patients better. As we’ve had through this entire surge, we have capacity. The number of ICU beds and ventilator capacity has been adequate. And that’s significantly thanks to our heroic caregivers on the front lines, as well as working with Secretary Mayhew, Director Moskowitz, directly with the governor himself, the surgeon general, have been able to be incredibly responsive to the needs that we have had and asked for.',\n",
              "  'Gino Santorio: (16:23) In addition to the state effectively getting us some of the necessary drugs that have made a significant impact in the survivability such as remdesivir, they’ve also helped us in an area that is a significant need across the state, which was staffing. We currently, in our system, have 131 employees that are a combination of respiratory therapists, nurses, and certified nursing assistants, which have been able to help supplement our own staff to be able to ensure that we can effectuate a surge above and beyond what current numbers are today should we have needed them. We would never, as a safety net hospital, turn away a patient. Safety nets in the state of Florida represent about 12% of the hospitals yet we’ve treated over 50% of the COVID hospitalized patients. And a lot of the resources that enable us to do that have come not just from the state and internally, but have come at a very rapid turnaround.',\n",

I would be remiss if I did not mention that despite the fact that Florida has the fifth oldest median population, our survivability of this virus has significantly outpaced what the expectations were. And that’s a true testament to the fact that we’ve been able to protect the most vulnerable population, via testing, staffing, drugs, and being able to ensure that our longterm and post acute care facilities such as our skilled nursing facilities have had testing of both the residents and the-',\n",

You heard the governor speak about our COVID only facilities that have been stood up. That has been an absolute, huge success factor in survivability of COVID, and maintaining a low mortality rate. So, very pleased to report that. I do want to encourage, and we’ve joined our hospital partners as well as additional healthcare partners in South Florida to come together. We launched a campaign called caringforsouthflorida.org that encourages, and really follows suit with the One Florida campaign from the governor’s office to really encourage, and maintain the diligence around social responsibility, social distancing, masking, et cetera.',\n",

              "  'Dave Lacknauth: (19:13) Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Dave Lacknauth, executive director of pharmacy service [inaudible 00:19:16] for Broward Health. A pleasure to speak on behalf of Broward Health today, and the state of Florida. The items that I wanted to cover today are just our clinical response to COVID, and with our clinical teams, what we’ve been able to assemble. We’ve worked really hard upon initiation of hearing about COVID. We are a very close knit group of physicians and pharmacies from a therapeutic management standpoint here at Broward Health. We brought together the key physician groups that really kind of, I say, drive the clinical bus when it comes to treating our COVID patients. That’s our intensivists. I want to give them a ton of credit.',\n",
              "  'Dave Lacknauth: (19:54) They are on call for us night, day, weekends, anytime they are there for us. Our infectious disease physicians as well, same thing. They are on call, they’re on board, they’re working with us to drive what I call that clinical bus in making sure we have the right therapies for supportive care around COVID. The care that we provide for COVID for our patients that are hospitalized is critical, and important. In this day and age, what we find out is the one thing we understand is everything changes every day. Data comes out tomorrow that we didn’t see today, data is going to come out in two weeks that we don’t know from tomorrow.',\n",
              "  'Dave Lacknauth: (20:33) Our job with our clinical team is that we quickly pull the data in, review the data, validate the information that’s in the data, and then, come out with what we’re going to do moving forward around treatment, and treatment of our patients. I just want to again, give credit to the infectious disease doctors, and our intensivists, and our medical staff leadership for being available, and being available to interpret this information for the most effective treatment for our patients today. I want to thank the state. I’m the guy on the phone. [inaudible 00:21:09] my phone call too, and our governor, and our state really supported us when we were running low on some critical medications.',\n",
              "  'Dave Lacknauth: (21:18) They were able to ensure we got what we needed, when we needed it to ensure our patients had the supplies and medication portfolio that they would need for our clinicians to then administer care. Again, I just want to keep it brief with an overview of what we’re doing clinically to support our patients that come into Broward Health. If you do come into Broward Health for COVID or non-COVID issues, our clinical teams are here to support you, and you will receive the best care that we can possibly give to you with the most up to date information. I’m going to hand over now to [Dr. Lunches 00:00:21:55]. He’s our chief medical officer for Broward Health Medical Center to expand on a little bit more.',\n",
              "  'Dr. Lunches: (22:04) Thank you as Mr. [Inaudible 00:22:06] and the governor had mentioned, it’s been a few difficult weeks. Obviously, this wave has presented more than a few challenges, which I’m proud to say our caregivers have been incredibly resilient, and have risen to the challenge as we expected them to do. Now, the state’s provision of staffing and pharmaceuticals has enabled our caregivers to continue to provide that quality of care that the community has come to expect from us. You heard the governor say, unlike the first wave, the patients that we’re seeing this time around are a little bit younger, and their conditions are a little less severe. That has helped us with facilitating their throughput through the hospitalization, which is obviously the most important part of their care.',\n",
              "  'Dr. Lunches: (22:49) The patient’s outcomes of course are predicated on our knowledge of the ever evolving landscape of COVID-19, as you heard Dave Lacknauth talk about. We do use things like remdesivir, convalescent plasma is used so long as we can get it, and you’ve heard really what we need the most though, is for the community to help us help them, and the way that they could do that is by adhering to the pivotal components of the governor’s platform where we protect the vulnerable, where you wear your mask, where you do hand hygiene, and where you physically distance.',\n",
              "  'Dr. Lunches: (23:27) That means that a closed, prolonged contact is not something that we should be doing. This is something that we’ve advocated from the very beginning, washing your hands, wearing a mask, a little bit of that as has changed, but that’s really the best advice that we could give to the community to help us help them. Thank you.',\n",
              "  'Cheryl Wilde: (23:50) I am Cheryl Wilde. I represent nursing for the facilities in Broward Health. I would just like to say that I very much support what my clinical partners have just said. The care that we’re giving the patients is amazing. The caregivers, I cannot stand here without thanking them. The caregivers, the nursing teams, the respiratory therapists, everyone who’s come out to really give everything that they have this last five months or so has been very challenging for them. I cannot thank the governor, and the state enough for the support that they’ve given us, the staffing, and the nursing who have really just come out, and help to support our system. The care that we’re giving our patients, again, is top rate. Our outcomes have been very, very good, and I’m just very, very thankful for all the support that we have received from the state at this point.',\n",
              "  'Governor DeSantis: (24:49) Well, thanks so much. We really appreciate all the hard work. I think the average member of the public understands that people in health care often have to work hard, and I think that they assume that in a situation like that, that’s even doubly, but dealing with an infectious disease like this really is labor intensive, because even if you guys have someone in a car accident, they swab positive, you’ve got to do all kinds of procedures to isolate, to make sure that you’re keeping it from spreading throughout your facility. It requires a lot of folks to work a lot of hours, work very hard. Obviously, you have PPE and everything, but none of that is foolproof, so people are potentially exposing themselves as patients come in.',\n",
              "  'Governor DeSantis: (25:33) Although, I think the track record has been really good with our healthcare workers in terms of using that equipment. It’s been a real challenge, and I think that the folks really have stepped up, done a great job. We are happy to be able to provide some support, and we’re going to continue to keep that support going for as long as you need it. I’m encouraged about your trends. I think that, that’s a really good sign. We look at all these different things. This number of tests, or that, but some of that is based on how many people you’re testing? What’s your testing criteria? When are the labs reporting all this?',\n",
              "  'Governor DeSantis: (26:07) But, the people showing up at the emergency department, or the people that are being admitted or discharged here, that’s just the reality of what the disease is doing, and I think the fact that they’re either discharging people, they’re generating a lot of positive outcomes compared to what you would have seen in February and March, either in the United States, or in other parts of the world. That’s really, really encouraging, and we’re obviously excited to be able to provide remdesivir, work with the White House to do that, and as other things come down the pike, we want to continue to be helpful.',\n",
              "  'Governor DeSantis: (26:40) But, we are here to help South Florida. We really appreciate. It’s been a challenge for the whole state, don’t get me wrong. The first kind of time we had South Florida, and then, the rest of the state was relatively modest in terms of the prevalence. This time, I think everyone saw more prevalence, but of course, here in Broward and Miami-Dade, you’ve seen the most, and so, I really appreciate how great everyone’s responded.',\n",
              "  'Governor DeSantis: (27:03) … you’ve seen the most. And so I really appreciate how great everyone’s responded with that. I’m happy to take a question or two. Yes, ma’am?',\n",
              "  'Governor DeSantis: (27:15) I got tested like two days ago, so I’m not sure when that would have happened or whatnot. So I’m tested regularly, and I don’t have, or have not had any symptoms. So the number of times I’ve been tested has been pretty significant, and I’ve had my temperature checked probably a hundred times just in the last few months. Yes ma’am?',\n",
              "  'Governor DeSantis: (27:38) Is that Glenna? Oh, hi.',\n",
              "  'Glenna: (27:52) [inaudible 00:27:47].',\n",

              "  'Glenna: (28:12) So remember [inaudible 00:01:02]. I’m wondering if you can speak to [inaudible 00:28:29].',\n",
              "  'Governor DeSantis: (28:33) Yep. Well, a couple of things. One is the family should be notified if a family member is transferred to an isolation center. I thought that that was being done, but I’m going to look to see, because they need to. Obviously, if there’s a positive case, the nursing homes are required to notify the families with that, but they should also do that.',\n",
              "  'Governor DeSantis: (28:55) So these isolation centers are following all the CDC guidelines. They have negative pressure, they have to be able to do that in order to get approved by AHCA. So as long as they’re following those rules, it’s going to be safe, and if somebody is COVID-positive and is put there, they are not allowed to be mixed, if you do have a situation like that, with the general population, of course not. That would defeat the whole purpose of doing the transfer in the first place. Because if we’re going to do that, we could have just left them in the nursing facilities. The nursing facilities, we do have many just regular nursing facilities that have the ability to isolate. We have 4,000 plus, most of them don’t have that ability. Some do. So if you have the ability to isolate, and you have a positive test or two, you can isolate the residents appropriately. And obviously not allow that to get into the general public. But for those, which are the majority, who do not have the capability of isolating, they’re required to be transferred to a place that can be safely isolated. Sometimes that’s hospitals. And when we were in April and May, we would see a lot of transfers, but when the patient is not requiring hospitalization to have a COVID-only nursing facility where they can safely isolate, convalesce, and then be discharged safely back is a really good tool.',\n",
              "  'Governor DeSantis: (30:23) But I think the families, they need to be kept apprised on that. So I’m going to talk to Secretary Mayhew and make sure that that’s the case. Believe me, there’d be no reason to transfer anyone unless it was necessary for safety. But I think as we found, that when you have these outbreaks that run unchecked in a nursing facility you are going to see major clinical consequences for that in terms of hospitalizations, and unfortunately in terms of a longterm care facility resident deaths. Yes sir?',\n",
              "  'Speaker 2: (30:55) Governor [inaudible 00:30:59], wearing a mask be [inaudible 00:31:05]. I’m curious if you’ve had any [inaudible 00:31:09]?',\n",
              "  'Governor DeSantis: (31:17) So I haven’t talked to the White House. But I’ve tried to say from the beginning, well certainly over the last few months when it became apparent, the number one source of outbreaks is in the home. And so that becomes a specific challenge… My house, my wife and I, I got young kids, we’re not in the risk categories, but you’ve got a lot of families in Florida where you’ll have multi generational living, or even if they’re not under the same roof, particularly you look like a county like Miami-Dade, you just have a lot of family that live in the area, and they’re getting together. They’re doing what normal families do. The risk, and either if you’re under the same roof the whole time or if you’re in close contact, is that those more vulnerable relatives, whether it’s a parent, a grandparent, an uncle, they then can be exposed by younger people who may not be visibly demonstrating symptoms.',\n",
              "  'Governor DeSantis: (32:10) And so I think it’s something that people should absolutely look at, whether it’s the mask, whether it’s isolation. I think there’s a lot of different ways, but just to understand protecting our vulnerable, part of that is if you’re in those vulnerable groups you need to do what you can do to avoid crowds, to protect yourself. But everyone else also has a responsibility to govern themselves accordingly where they’re not providing any type of a danger to them.',\n",
              "  'Governor DeSantis: (32:41) But I would also say though, the physical distancing, avoiding the close contact in an enclosed environment, that should not be put aside. So you’re going to do the mask in addition to that, but just understand if you’re in very close sustained contact, particularly with some of those cloth masks, you don’t have a hundred percent protection of the droplets. You’re talking about it will intercept hopefully some, hopefully most, but certainly not all. So people shouldn’t have a false sense of security on that. You still got to do the sanitation. You still got to do the physical distancing.',\n",
              "  'Speaker 3: (33:14) [inaudible 00:33:14] so they can return to school safely?',\n",
              "  'Governor DeSantis: (33:58) So in terms of the education, our primary policy is that parents should have a choice if they want to do distance learning because they don’t want in-person instruction right now, they should have the ability to do that.',\n",
              "  'Governor DeSantis: (34:12) But then for the many parents who really do believe that their kids need to be in the classroom, we want that choice as well. The Department of Education is working in conjunction with the Department of Health, with districts on a district-by-district basis, and they are also working with their local county health departments to be able to devise the best safety plans.',\n",
              "  'Governor DeSantis: (34:32) I think that there’s a number of things that they may have in common. But I also think that a plan in Miami-Dade may look a little bit different than some of the other counties, which may be more rural, and may have less prevalence. But I’d also say that we are happy to see single-digit positivity statewide for two days in a row. We had been mired in 15, 16%. We did have it go down to 11, 12, and then to see this decline, I hope that that trend continues. I think people have really been doing their part to make sure that it does.',\n",
              "  'Governor DeSantis: (35:09) Thanks everybody.'],\n",
              " ['Governor Gavin Newsom: (06:54) No. That’s not on. Good afternoon. A couple of months back, in fact on June 1st, we announced with some urgency our concerns about what was happening in Imperial County, California. The county had experienced a significant rise in number of transmissions related to COVID-19. Concern was made more paramount as it relates to the overwhelming situation for the hospital system, not only in the ICUs, but the ability to provide for emergency care more broadly, diversion rates for ambulances, health care personnel questions, a lot of stress that was placed because of this pandemic on the county. On June 1st, we committed to a new process, a new protocol to help support the county in their efforts. Began the process of decompressing their hospital system. Over 650 patients were moved out of Imperial County hospitals into surrounding and neighboring communities. And, in some instances, we even brought patients here into Northern California.',\n",
              "  'Governor Gavin Newsom: (08:33) We approached our strategy in the county more as a strike team, more as a unified command approach, something you would see more traditionally as it relates to how we organize and construct our approach to dealing with other emergencies like wildfires and the like. That process took shape, again, in the beginning of June, at a time when we had transmission rates, positivity rates, North of 30% in Imperial County. In fact, it peaked at 30.3%.',\n",
              "  'Governor Gavin Newsom: (09:09) You could see on this graph the number of cases reflected in Imperial County in the blue line substantially outpacing the number of cases in the rest of the state. This graph certainly presents itself as a spike in cases in Imperial County. That required a new approach, new strategies, and new accountability structures. And that’s exactly what took place. The model now, as we’re referring to it, the Imperial Model was all about providing supports, building capacity at the local level, filling in gaps, meeting needs both on personal protective gear, not just personnel, meeting the needs of the hospital system, providing additional supports, new strategies, and prevention from PSA campaigns, culturally competent messages that were delivered to individuals as well as businesses and, more broadly, the community at large.',\n",
              "  'Governor Gavin Newsom: (10:07) In addition to sectoral closures that we made abundantly clear, as it relates to moving forward to address the concerns that were flaring up in certain sectors of the economy in the Valley. You can see on this slide the number of cases as they began to spike. We began to intervene. You can see the medical personnel that we began to send in around June 3rd, where we worked with, not only state, and county, and local officials, but broadened that support by getting a lot of federal supports as well from a number of federal agencies.',\n",
              "  'Governor Gavin Newsom: (10:47) You can see, after those interventions were put into place, again, beginning with the decompressing of the hospital system as a foundational principle, more targeted supports, and some additional sectoral changes as it relates to returning to a stay at home order, you could see that line spiked and substantially began its decline. 30.3%, yesterday’s positivity rate. Still high, but at 11.2%. A successful approach, one that requires constant vigilance, one that we’re continuing to engage in, but one that long windedly is now become a model in terms of our approach, the Imperial approach in other parts of the state.',\n",
              "  'Governor Gavin Newsom: (11:36) Last week, where we last joined each other, I began the process of announcing strategies in the Central Valley, in eight counties in the Central Valley, for the obvious reason that you could see exampled here on this chart. We’re starting to see, not only an increase in the positivity rates. I mentioned last week where I made some announcements about our interventions in Central Valley, that we saw positivity rates on the lower end in Fresno, at the time at 10.7%, and peaking around Tulare at a 17.7% rate. Not where we were in Imperial, but we don’t want to see it go to where Imperial went. And that’s why we felt it was appropriate to intervene using the information, using the experience, the best practice, the data collection, the approach in Imperial and beginning that approach in the Central Valley.',\n",
              "  'Governor Gavin Newsom: (12:32) Why the Central Valley? Well, again, this slide underscores the concerns. You’re starting to see the hospitalization and ICU rates increase, not just positivity rates in the Valley, outpacing the rest of California. And, if you asked me today what our biggest area of concern in a state as large as ours, it is indeed the Central Valley. We’re seeing stabilization in other parts of the state. You’ll see some declines in a moment, when I make presentation, including some stabilization and some modest declines in Southern California. The Central Valley, again, reinforced by this slide, reinforced by our presentation in Stockton last week, in our announcement last week is indeed the area of our most important targeted interventions.',\n",
              "  'Governor Gavin Newsom: (13:24) We are, again, doing everything we can to fill in local gaps and working with counties to assess their current dashboard, as it relates to data collection, identifying whatever gaps may exist or persist in their respective communities. But more importantly than anything else, identifying partners, not just partners from governmental agencies, again, federal agencies, five out of the eight Department of Defense medical teams are deployed now in the Central Valley, again federal partnerships, but also developing private partnerships. Critical to develop partnerships with employers. Critical to develop partnerships with nongovernmental organizations, nonprofits, NGOs, to again, build capacity and build our collective response with a unified command approach to addressing the concerns in the Valley.',\n",
              "  'Governor Gavin Newsom: (14:19) And so, that’s exactly what we highlighted last week. We built that partnership to include 52 million dollars of new resources for disease investigation, for contact tracing, and for our isolation and quarantine efforts. In addition to that, we have been able to… and I want to thank the Sierra Health Foundation in particular. They have been able to organize a collective effort, 6.5 million of additional dollars, resources that philanthropy has brought to the table, to supplement, or increase rather, the 52 million dollar contribution that we announced last week. And this is for rent, supplies, really helping individuals with utility bills, and the like. And focusing-',\n",
              "  'Governor Gavin Newsom: (15:03) … individuals utility bills and the like, and focusing on the most vulnerable and the most vulnerable families. And remember, this is, and Dr. Galley has made this abundantly clear in a number of his presentations, we’ve made it abundantly clear over the course of the last number of months as well. Disproportionately, this disease is impacting our diverse communities. Disproportionately impacting the Latino community, disproportionately impacting the community in the Central Valley. And so when we talk about the Central Valley, I hope we can really paint a picture in terms of our consciousness of how impactful this has been on the Latinx community. And that’s why our targeted interventions disproportionately are focusing on essential workforce, on farm workers, on critical workforce and hospitality, retail sector, and the like that is being impacted by this disease.',\n",
              "  'Governor Gavin Newsom: (15:57) And so I wanted to begin today as we left off last week, reinforcing the merits of the approach we took in Imperial County, recognizing again, good enough never is, recognizing as I do, as we do, that the effort is ongoing. There’s a constancy to our focus. There’s not just a passing interest in these efforts. They’re not episodic. There’s a full blown commitment to follow through, to bend this curve, to suppress the growth and ultimately extinguish this virus, which is indeed our long term goal, or at least mitigate its impacts through therapeutics and vaccination. As it relates to the efforts statewide to do the same, I want to give you some good news. And that is, our number of positive cases yesterday was 5,739. That is a one day number. And again, I’ve made this point abundant over the past and that is, I don’t look to one day numbers.',\n",
              "  'Governor Gavin Newsom: (17:01) They go up, they go down, there’s some weekend reporting often that is example, on Mondays. That’s why the seven day average becomes even more important. And that seven day average you’ll see, it’s 7,764. That seven day average by the way is down roughly 21.2% from the previous seven day average. That’s good news. 21.2% decline. The last time you saw a slide like this, the numbers was North of 9,800 daily average cases, 9,859 to be exact. So from 9,859 cases, seven day average from a week ago, now down 7,764, 21.2% decline from our previous reporting period. Again, that’s case numbers. And I caution folks, look, I’ve said this in the past, others have said this, some for different purposes than the purpose which we reinforce this. As we increase our tests, you’re going to see an increase in case numbers. I caution people not to focus as much on that, but to look at positivity rates and look at hospital rates and ICU rates in the state of California.',\n",
              "  'Governor Gavin Newsom: (18:21) They’ve become more profoundly significant from the perspective of mortality, from the perspective of our healthcare, delivery system and our capacity. We want to test as many people as we can, but the purpose of the test is not just to show a number, it’s an effort to have a sense of where the community is spread is, how we can mitigate that spread, how we can help support our contact tracers, isolate, quarantine people, and ultimately mitigate the impact to our hospital system and into our ICUs. And so that’s why the positivity rate, this number, you’ve watched these presentations, you’re very familiar with this slide. This positivity rate is so important. Here is extending on the narrative of some early good signs, 21.2% decline in the seven day average total number of positive cases. But the positivity rate is also seeing a decline as we’ve increased our daily average tests.',\n",
              "  'Governor Gavin Newsom: (19:21) And you can see the number 126,000, almost 127,000 daily average test. About 140, just shy of 149,000 tests yesterday. A little bit more than that the day prior. We actually reached 177,000 tests a few days ago. But our average daily tests continue to go up. The good news is the total number of people testing positive is now going down. We have gone down to 7%. This reflected in this slide over a 14 day period shows that 7.5% number that we presented to you on multiple occasions, now again, tracking down to 7%. This is the 14 day number. I often provide you the seven day positivity rate. The last time I was with you, we made a presentation formally with you where I shared slides, which was on the 24th of July, not the presentation in Stockton last week. The seven day positivity rate was 7.8%. Got to about 8% at its peak. The seven day positivity rate is lower now than the 14 days. It’s down to 6.1%.',\n",
              "  'Governor Gavin Newsom: (20:39) So 14 day positivity rate reflected in the slide, 7%. The seven day positivity rate now down to 6.1%. It’s not where it needs to be and is still too high. But again, it is good to see this number trending down, not trending up. Not surprisingly, as we see positivity rate begin to trend down, increased number of people being tested, percentage of people being tested relative to the numbers. Being tested, lower. We are now not surprisingly seeing hospitalizations go down modestly. 10% decrease in the total number of positive cases in our hospitals over a 14 day period, 10% decrease. The last time I shared slides with you, we had seen a 9% increase. Remember, it was much as 50% a few weeks back over a 14 day period. So 50%, 50% growth. Now we’re seeing 10% decline. Last slide set, we shared with you over a week ago, showed a 9% increase. So again, a decline in total hospitalizations, not surprisingly. You’ll see the healthcare system capacity with total number of patients declining. It’s just shy of 9% of our total capacity.',\n",
              "  'Governor Gavin Newsom: (22:07) It’s holding relatively steady, not increasing as you’ve seen in some previous slides. Hospitalizations go down, we encourage to see ICU admissions also trending down. Last slide deck, we provided 11% increase in ICU admissions. You’ll see reflected in this slide, 5% decrease in ICU admissions. So again, these are statewide numbers. It does not reflect the reality in the Central Valley, doesn’t necessarily reflect the reality where you are living in a particular county, a particular part of the state, but the overall trend, both again, positivity rates, hospitalizations, now ICU is showing a decrease from where we were over a week ago. Encouraging signs, but one week does not make a kind of trend that gives us confidence to generate headlines. We are looking forward to that and we’ll need to see another few weeks of this kind of data to come in, to feel more confident about where we are as a state.',\n",
              "  'Governor Gavin Newsom: (23:14) The good news is we do feel confident in our critical care capacity. The ICU numbers declining. The total number of ICU patients reflected here in this graph to our capacity dropped modestly from 23% to 9% hospitalizations, about 9%. But did not decline, still within a percentage point here, we were able to see modest decline over the last reporting period when we presented the slide deck. 38 counties are now on our monitoring list. You’ll recall 37 counties when we announced that Santa Clara County was added to our list when we were in Stockton last week. Now 38 counties, this includes San Mateo County on low list. 58 counties in the state of California though, again, these 38 counties represent the vast majority of the population in the state. And this county monitoring, this is profoundly important to all of you that live in those counties as it relates to the sectorial guidelines we put out more restrictive in these counties than in other counties, and certainly more restrictive as it relates to reopening our schools.',\n",
              "  'Governor Gavin Newsom: (24:34) Goal ultimately is to get off this list for two weeks. And that gives us some confidence based on CDC guidelines, our own experience here in the state of California to consider making modifications. And certainly along the guidelines that we put out, as it relates to our public education system and private school system as well. That 14 day period is foundational in terms of any subsequent modifications to distance learning, which is foundationally required in these 38 counties. I’ll conclude as always to encourage people. If you are living with an individual who’s tested positive for COVID-19, it’s incredibly important because of mixed families, multigenerational families. We’re seeing a lot of spread now in people’s backyards, their front yards as well is in their living rooms. And that’s why we thought important to reinforce, remind people of the importance.',\n",

Don’t share items, do the kind of disinfecting that is foundational in terms of mitigating the spread of this disease. We’ll continue to highlight this area of focus as it continues to be one of the more challenging in vaccine areas in terms of mitigating the spread of the coronavirus. Accordingly, we remind you as always, the most important non-pharmaceutical intervention you can make is wearing these masks, again, doing everything in your power to physically distance yourself from people that are not part of that cohort and your household. Continue to wash your hands more broadly and minimize mixing. I just want to reinforce this. It needs to be reinforced even more. Minimize mixing to the extent possible.',\n",

And so that’s the update for the day. I want to just make one final point reference, and it’s an important, and that is total number of deaths in this state has increased over the course of the last few weeks. This, again, for us is a point of obvious concern. And for the family members, each and every life lost is devastating and our heart goes out. Including a young person in Fresno that lost their lives, a teenager. And this is a sober reminder of how deadly this disease is and how it can impact anybody. And while it’s absolutely true, and I don’t want to be an alarmist, it’s absolutely true that number of people that contact this disease that are in their late teens, even early teens, the likelihood of deaths is very, very low.',\n",

And it’s just sober reminder of how powerful and impactful and deadly this disease remains to be and how important it is to do the kind of work we all must do as a society, as a community and as individuals to do what we can to mitigate that spread, to wear those masks, to physically distance, to avoid the kind of mixing large crowds and outside your immediate household as much as you possibly can. 32 additional lives were lost in our last reporting period yesterday. But I want to just caution you, 32 is a lower number than you’ve seen in the past. The average numbers now well North of 100, and with the increase we’ve experienced over the last few weeks, the lagging number, lagging indicator always in term of the deaths, this number is reflected as a lagging indicator, meaning we’re likely to see those numbers remain stubbornly high over the course of the next number of days, potentially next week or so.',\n",

So that’s an update on where we are. I again want to remind everybody of the importance of targeting our focus and continuing to build capacity and build partnerships. We continue to do that county by county, health director by health director, and business by business. And I will be remiss. I’ll just close on this. I want to thank the business community.

The vast majority of businesses are doing everything in their power, doing their best under these very difficult circumstances, and the vast majority that are not 100% in compliance come into compliance very, very quickly. I want to just acknowledge that and recognize that perfect rarely is on the menu. People are doing their best under extraordinary circumstances both as individuals, as customers, as employers, their employees. It’s exampled in all the outreach that’s been done and the incredible compliance that we’ve seen. We haven’t seen it everywhere, and we are putting out citations.

So could you update us on what is happening with that process of contact tracing?',\n",

If you are in a gathering or you find yourself you may have been exposed on Sunday because there were people that were around you, wouldn’t Monday’s test show that you’re positive? When are you actually infected that a test would show whether you’re positive or negative accurately? We’ve been hearing also about vitamin D to boost the immune system. That’s resurfacing again. So if we can clear up if that means anything, I’d appreciate that. Thank you.',\n",
              "  'Governor Gavin Newsom: (37:34) No, I appreciate the questions. Dr. Ghaly will be up here in just a moment. Let me just say a number of things, and we’ve made number of presentations over the course of the last number of months as it relates to our partnership with UCSF, our partnership with UCLA to train a cohort of contact tracers. We announced a few weeks back that we have trained over 10,000, meeting our Phase 1 goals of contact tracers.',\n",
              "  'Governor Gavin Newsom: (38:01) We made additional modifications to our approach and the protocols relating to contact tracing based upon the increase in the total number of positive cases statewide that required a modification of some of our original strategies related to contact tracing, including, by the way, making available contact tracers. This is fundamental in terms of keeping our children and teachers safe in the upcoming school years when we do reopen for in-person learning, which is foundational and is ultimately our goal and our commitment, if we can mitigate the spread and see a decline in the spread of this disease.',\n",
              "  'Governor Gavin Newsom: (38:43) But to make available to the school districts, in partnership with local health officials, these same contact tracers, we have a new database system. We’ve been very fortunate to have the opting-in of the vast majority of counties into the statewide database system. It’s a system that is also being utilized and deployed in some other states, including Massachusetts, and that provides the ability in real time to share information in this space.',\n",
              "  'Governor Gavin Newsom: (39:11) With that, let me ask Dr. Ghaly to provide you a little bit more information about the contact tracing, talk a little bit about vitamin D, and talk about when indeed someone who may have been exposed, what is that gestation period for determining if indeed they have tested positive or indeed are a carrier, even asymptomatic carrier, of COVID-19. Dr. Ghaly.',\n",
              "  'Dr. Ghaly: (39:42) Thank you, Governor. So with contact tracing, as we’ve talked about over the last couple of weeks, as we build up our contact tracing workforce across the state, really building upon what our counties had in place pre-COVID and really building upon their own efforts to increase their contact tracing workforce, coupled with that important disease investigation part, where people with trained skills in public health and epidemiology try to understand where the case originated from, not just identifying those close contacts so that we can make sure people who need testing, who need to quarantine or isolate do so in a safe, supported way for the appropriate amount of time.',\n",
              "  'Dr. Ghaly: (40:30) So we continue to build up that workforce in anticipation that as we continue to do the things we know reduce our case counts, we build up that workforce so that we match them and we can begin to identify all new cases and support those so that they don’t become big outbreaks as we try to reduce transmission.',\n",
              "  'Dr. Ghaly: (40:51) Your excellent question about when somebody should be tested, about three weeks ago, we unveiled a new testing prioritization criteria, not just who should be tested, but which labs should be run first. We’ve been experiencing increased turnaround times for our labs in California as a result of widespread testing across the nation. Those big national labs, we’re seeing their turnaround times go up pretty high. So we wanted to make sure that we had the sickest people, the people with the most clear and obvious COVID symptoms get their tests run first.',\n",
              "  'Dr. Ghaly: (41:29) So the first thing to say is if you are at all symptomatic with COVID-19-like symptoms, we encourage you to get tested immediately. Reach out to a provider, if you have one. Go to the covid19.ca.gov website. Go to our testing page and sign up for a test there. We think that should happen immediately. If you are a close contact, that means somebody who spent 15 or more minutes six or so feet closer to somebody who’s known COVID-positive, let’s say in an indoor gathering where you’re not, unfortunately, using a mask, we know that the masks protect quite a bit in reducing transmission. If you’re experiencing symptoms, you should go immediately and get tested. If you’re not and you’re a close contact, waiting about two days roughly after that contact I think is probably the best time to go get tested.',\n",
              "  'Dr. Ghaly: (42:20) But what we always say is a test, a negative test today tells you that you were negative at this moment. It doesn’t mean that you aren’t going to be positive the next day or even the next hour. So we encourage you if you’re a close contact to somebody who’s positive and you’ve been exposed that you do what we’ve recommended in terms of quarantining, self-quarantining for that period of 14 days. It’s very absolutely important.',\n",
              "  'Dr. Ghaly: (42:48) As it relates to vitamin D and other things to enhance your immune system, as a physician, we always want people to practice good, healthy behaviors. Make sure that you get your rest, that you eat well, that if your doctor or somebody has recommended vitamins, that you take those in order that we make sure that everyone is as well-positioned and suited to fight off not just COVID-19, but anything else that might be mixing around the community.',\n",

I know a number of our healthcare partners across the state are thinking about the upcoming flu season as we prepare to have flu vaccines made available in a number of a number of our clinics and our workplaces. As we think about COVID-19 on the one hand and flu on the other, we’re really trying to make sure that everybody is as healthy as they can be to be able to fend off either one of these important infectious diseases.',\n",

I think it is all of the above and growing recognition in a state where we flattened the curve, we never experienced the spikes other parts of the country experienced, in our own capacity to manifest, meaning our own individual capacity to make better decisions, to physically distance, to wash our hands, to avoid mixing, as well as the modifications. Let’s be candid, these sectoral modifications that have been very, very difficult and very trying for small businesses in particular that have just beared a huge brunt of the-',\n",

All of these things in total have made the impact, at least as it relates to what we’re experiencing recently. That said, these are just a few days, five out of six days. We’ve seen a decline in ICUs. We’ve seen some stabilization in most parts of the state, though not in every part of the state, Central Valley being the obvious area of concern and hospitalizations is encouraging. At the same time, we can quickly find ourselves back to where we were just a few weeks ago, a month ago, with significant increases if we do not maintain our vigilance, if we do not maintain our focus and our commitment.',\n",

It’s not going to take Halloween off or the holidays off until we have quality of therapeutics, until we have a vaccine, we are going to be living with this virus. And I think if there’s any lesson that we’ve learned from the California experience, while it is true the positivity rates in this state have never manifested as they have in other parts of this country, the reality is our first effort, we made tremendous progress because 40 million strong really met that moment and did everything in their power to mitigate the growth and spread of this virus.',\n",

We started to see that case rate grow. We started to see the background rates begin to grow, the community spread begin to grow. And so we had to tighten that back up. So let us not make that, well, let’s not relive that experience again, as we work again, our way through the first wave of this pandemic. We anticipate the second wave in the fall. And that second wave also challenged by what Dr. Ghaly just said, as it relates to flu season on top of COVID-19 likely having a resurgence in that second wave around the same time and the impact that can have, and the stress that can have on our system. And so all of this is just a reminder of the vigilance that is required at the moment.',\n",

Governor Hogan, the current chair, soon to be the ex-chair, a new chair will be coming in this month, a Republican governor from Maryland, who’s just been an outstanding partner to governors all across the state, making that organization available, sharing best practices in real time, providing resources to really drill down on the merit of your question. Looking at procurement strategies, looking at testing protocols, looking at contact tracing and the like. And so across the spectrum, we’ve been able to resource one another, pick the brains of our respective colleagues, as well as connect as we have more formally, as you recall with our Western States approach, where they have the ability now in real time, we have the ability in real time through that partnership to engage.',\n",
              "  'Governor Gavin Newsom: (56:05) Our chiefs of staff have consistent, I think it’s a weekly now, calls, where they’re comparing and contrasting best practices, discussing things that they’re considering, their respective governors and administrations are considering in terms of announcements or approaches and really getting feedback in real time. It’s turned out to be an extraordinarily robust partnership and turned out partnership is working in ways that perhaps people did not anticipate in the beginning. And so it’s just an example to give you a sense of the kind of work that we’re doing in the spirit of collaboration and sharing of best practices. And practices, frankly, that all of us want to push to the dustbin.',\n",
              "  'Governor Gavin Newsom: (56:48) That said, the broader issue around what we’re looking for is a consistent decline or consistent stabilization. Now, I caution, we had consistent stabilization in our ICUs, in hospitalizations and positivity rates in the state early on in this pandemic. And so it’s not just stabilizations we’re looking for, is we want to see some marked decline stabilization and a commensurate effort, which is critical of education about any modification, subsequent modifications, to our guidance and stay at home orders and sectoral strategies.',\n",
              "  'Governor Gavin Newsom: (57:31) What I think is the most important thing that I’ve reflected on the last number of months, I’ve made this comment in the past, is that when we began to modify our state home orders, we were focused, as understandably we needed to be, with industry and employers. And we needed to be equally focused in educating the public about what these modifications were and were not. And so a big and focused education campaign around mitigating the spread of this virus and transmission of this virus after we’ve seen a decline, stabilization is foundational in terms of any subsequent efforts to reopen.',\n",
              "  'Governor Gavin Newsom: (58:17) And so that’s, we’re looking forward to, and based on this last week, we believe we will once again experience that stabilization, as long as people continue to practice the physical distancing that they’re so familiar with. Wear a mask, do what you can on sanitation, avoid, or at least minimize as much mixing as you possibly can.',\n",
              "  'Governor Gavin Newsom: (58:40) I appreciate everybody’s good work. I thank them for the well, everything we presented here today is because of you and your commitment, your resolve, and your hard work. And so I just want to extend appreciation for your patience, your perseverance and your faith and devotion to this cause of mitigating this disease, ending this pandemic here in the state. Look forward to catching back up, sharing some updated information in the next day or two. Thank you everybody.'],\n",

I want to begin by just saying thank you. Once again I want to say thank you to the healthcare workers, our doctors, our nurses, our healthcare professionals, everybody that’s on the frontline, we know how hard you’re [inaudible 00:02:05] and we’re incredibly grateful for what you’re doing in protecting Arizonans and protecting their lives and also to the business leaders and to the workforce in Arizona. This has been a challenging time for everyone. We’ve been having a lot of discussions with business leaders and leaders of employer organizations so we could make the best possible decisions and to all Arizonans. This is affecting everyone in our state. We’re in this together, we’ve asked you to do a lot and we’re going to share with you the results of where Arizona is today and it wouldn’t be happening without your partnership and participation.',\n",

              "  'Governor Doug Ducey: (03:21) Today’s numbers are 152,944 total COVID-19 cases. This week we have 2,751 average cases and my heart, prayers and thoughts go out to the 3,063 Arizona families who have lost a loved one to the coronavirus. All people in Arizona have been affected by COVID-19, none more so than these families and you are in our thoughts and our actions every day. In terms of Arizona’s trend today, our major metrics are headed in the right directions. COVID-like illness in emergency room has a downward trend. COVID patient, ICU and hospital bed use has a downward trend, and the percentage of positive tests in Arizona has a downward trend. Let’s run through the numbers. Blue line is COVID-like illness in Arizona, the gold line is influenza-like. If you look at the COVID-like, the blue line, you can see the two legs over the last two weeks are a dramatic drop down from 18.2% to 10.7. That’s in just two weeks that much of a decrease. Thank you to Arizonans for participating in this improvement.',\n",
              "  'Governor Doug Ducey: (05:02) Our COVID cases by day, if you can see on the chart, our cases began to ramp up in June and escalated. Through July, they’re headed in the other direction, so for several weeks, we had a trend going in the right direction. Now we’re seeing some … I’m sorry, in the beginning of June we had a trend headed in the wrong direction. Over the last couple weeks, you see the beginnings of a trend in the right direction. We need to continue that, headed in the right direction in terms of lessening our cases by day and most specifically in terms of lowering our positivity rate in Arizona. The blue mountain data graph is the number of tests in Arizona. The gold line is our percentage positivity. We’ve been as high as 21.1%. In this last week, a downward trend of 14.5%. It’s the right direction. It’s still too high, but it is headed in the right direction.',\n",
              "  'Governor Doug Ducey: (06:16) Let’s look at our hospital bed capacity. This does not include the 2,600 additional surge beds in our preparation for a potential worst case scenario, but what you see here is capacity. The gold is the COVID-like illness or the patients that do have COVID inside our hospitals. If you look at the course of the last six weeks, you’ll see an increase, a flattening, and the beginnings of a slight decrease. You’ll see the same thing here with our ICU beds. It does not include the surge capacity beds that we had, but for the patients that have COVID, you’ve seen an increase, a flattening, and the beginning of a slight decrease. You’ll see the same trend here for ventilators around COVID-19.',\n",
              "  'Governor Doug Ducey: (07:13) Our testing by day, the blue line is PCR test, the orange is serology. We are over one million total tests in the state of Arizona with many more on the way. I want to thank Dr. Crow for the saliva test that ASU has innovated and will be bringing to market, Dr. Robbins for his leadership on the serology test. We do have some issues around demand for our testing. We have tests available and we want people to take advantage of that. We’re going to be talking about that a little bit later in the presentation.',\n",
              "  'Governor Doug Ducey: (07:55) Let’s talk about the recent actions that we’ve taken in Arizona to slow the spread of this virus. We’ve basically been prohibiting large gatherings. I want to thank our mayors and county superintendents, we have nearly 90% of our state with local mask ordinances. They make a real difference. We’ve paused operations on gyms, bars, nightclubs, water parks and tubing. Superintendent Hoffman and I delayed the first day of school and we’ve reduced restaurant capacity in Arizona.',\n",
              "  'Governor Doug Ducey: (08:37) So let’s look at how that has affected our results. Nearly three plus weeks ago, I introduced this number, the R0 number into our discussions. This is the number that represents the average number of people who become infected by an infectious person. When this number was introduced on June 29, Arizona was at 1.18, meaning for every infected person, more than one person was being infected. Over the last three weeks, Arizona has moved that number 20 basis points in the right direction. Our R0 in Arizona today is beneath one, and it’s been beneath one since July 15. So I want to thank you, that couldn’t happen without the participation of the citizens of Arizona, people are listening to the safer at home instruction, they’re limiting mobility, and it is resulting in positive numbers and direction for our state.',\n",
              "  'Governor Doug Ducey: (09:51) This is the New York Times showing daily cases per 100,000 individuals in the state. It tracks hot spots in Arizona. If you can see from the 14 day trend, in many parts of our state and specifically in the most populous parts of our state, we’re seeing a decline, but we’re not seeing a decline everywhere. So I’d ask you to continue to stay vigilant. To know no matter whether you’re in Phoenix, Tucson or a rural area, the virus is contagious, and if we don’t do the things we should be doing, it can begin to more rapidly spread.',\n",
              "  'Governor Doug Ducey: (10:37) These are the newly reported cases by day in Arizona according to the Times. You can see what a tough June the state of Arizona had, how it began to flatten with some of the mitigation measures we put forward several weeks ago and now we are seeing a decline in cases and we need to continue to see that. Now Arizona’s increase in cases begins in June. Our country had a flat June. Their escalation has been in July. That’s where we’ve seen our downturn.',\n",
              "  'Governor Doug Ducey: (11:15) I said last week that for weeks and weeks, Arizona was on this page every time I looked. This is where new cases are increasing in our nation. Today there’s 42 states and territories where new cases are increasing. Last week, for the first time, we moved to where new cases are mostly the same, and this week, for the first week, we’re one of two states in the country whee new cases are decreasing. That’s where we prefer to stay and that’s where some of the actions that people are taking in the mitigation can keep us. I hear the folks that don’t want to hear from the New York Times and don’t want to hear what they have to say, so if the New York Times isn’t good enough for you, take it from MSNBC. They also show a decrease for cases in the state of Arizona, and for folks who don’t want to hear from mainstream media outlets, take it from the gold standard of excellence in public health internationally, Johns Hopkins University of Medicine. To my eye, Arizona is the greenest state in the nation. That is a downward trend over the previous three days and we’ve been there now for the last two times that we visited. That’s where we would like to stay is with a downward trend.',\n",

They also let you go to a graph and whether you want to see it by state, region, nation or country, you can customize it. This is Arizona’s daily case count in red and our hospitalizations in blue. You can see very simply that we’ve hit a peak and we’ve begun to head in the right direction. Let’s continue that so that we don’t have another peak.',\n",
              "  'Governor Doug Ducey: (13:33) It’s not unusual after we finish the presentation and turn it over for questions of someone to ask every now and again how do we trust the numbers that Arizona is presenting. First I want you to know that the COVID tracking project gives Arizona an A+ for our data information and that’s the Arizona Department of Health Services, that’s AZHealth.gov, so I know Arizonans can deal with the truth. We just want to make sure that you have the facts at the end of this press conference.',\n",
              "  'Governor Doug Ducey: (14:11) Now let’s talk about Arizona’s new normal and what we see for the foreseeable future. We have been in the unhappy but necessary business of breaking up large adult gatherings. That’s why you’ve seen the businesses and venues here not operating or not operating in any of the traditional senses with people and fans and congregations, and that’s where we’re going to be for some time. So today we’re going to continue to press on with the strategies that are working in Arizona and continue them. So today’s announcements around mitigation are that the closure will be extended for gyms, bars, nightclubs, water parks, and tubing.',\n",
              "  'Governor Doug Ducey: (15:11) Now people ask how do we come up with these venues for closure, and I want you to know this is the direct recommendation from the Centers for Disease Control. So when you say your decisions are going to be guided by public health and not politics or what’s popular, you listen to public health and the recommendation for these venues is closure. That’s where we are at this time. So there’s no victory lap today. There’s no celebration. We cannot let up. We need to continue to be vigilant every day in the state of Arizona, to continue pressing and to make sure that we stay focused on the fundamentals. So no victory lap, no celebration, only continued physical distancing. Washing your hands and remembering that you’re safer at home.',\n",
              "  'Governor Doug Ducey: (16:19) In addition to that, one of the things that you can do that will make the biggest difference of course is wearing a mask and I want to thank Arizonans from all over the state, I’ve been sent pictures. I know the pictures that oftentimes make the media are the ones that are outliers but I know people all over our state and especially in large crowds and when they haven’t been able to socially distance are more often than not choosing to wear a mask and I want to thank you for doing that. We want to make sure that everybody that needs a mask has access to a mask. We want to make sure that masks are there for vulnerable Arizonans. We introduced this last week at the press conference and we’re proud to partner with Hanes to provide free cloth masks to Arizona’s most vulnerable residents and to prevent the spread of COVID-19. We’ve had over 44,000 mask orders that have been received and they’re shipping now. Thank you for the order and thank you for wearing your mask.',\n",

I want to thank the leaders in the advertising industry, [inaudible 00:17:46], High Noon, Off Madison, Urias, LT, R&R and HMA Public Relations. We brought them together, we challenged them to help us make wearing masks more ubiquitous and prevalent, pull the politics out of it, and make it part of what we need to do to get the pandemic behind us and we think that they’ve done some good work and there’s going to be an ad campaign. We’re going to be advocating and resourcing this campaign statewide. We’re grateful for their work and the campaign’s going to be called Tougher Than COVID.

I want to thank Superintendent of Public Instruction Kathy Hoffman for being a partner and a leader and for prioritizing Arizona children and safe and successful education in our state. I also want to thank Representative Michelle Udall and Senator Sylvia Allen for their effort and input into the plan that we’re going to present going forward, and with that, I want to turn it over to Superintendent Kathy Hoffman.

I am thankful for our continued collaboration to ensure that our school communities have the policies and supports that they need to be successful and safe in this upcoming school year. Since my first day as superintendent, I have stated my relentless optimism for public education, but I will be honest that my optimism has been tested over these past difficult months. The education community has been called on to completely rethink the system and adapt quickly to new policies and regulations. School leaders and educators are under a tremendous amount of stress as they plan for the upcoming school year and they have already done a great deal of work to plan for high quality learning opportunities for students this year, no matter where that learning will take place, but I cannot ask our educators and families to enter this school year without critical assurances, policies, and resources to set them up for safety and success.',\n",

Each of those pieces are extremely complex and have taken time and partnership to work through.',\n",

I also want to express my gratitude to the many education stakeholders, educators, and school leaders who have offered feedback and ideas each step of the way. Today’s plan is both comprehensive and flexible and will allow schools to adapt to the unique public health needs of their communities while doing what they do best, educating our students.',\n",
              "  'Kathy Hoffman: (23:02) While doing what they do best educating our students. I have said before that protecting our school communities is a statewide effort. I want to thank the members of our congressional delegation who have reached out to offer their advocacy for critical additional funding for schools and any upcoming relief packages. I also want to thank the Arizonans who have taken this pandemic seriously, who have made sacrifices, worn masks to protect themselves and their neighbors, physically distanced, and stayed home whenever possible. COVID-19 has impacted all of us. It has impacted my family, my staff, and my friends, my brother living in Italy was one of the first there to contract COVID-19 in February when there were still many unknowns. And thankfully he made a full recovery. My husband, a physician in residency at Phoenix Children’s Hospital, faces risks in his job every day.',\n",
              "  'Kathy Hoffman: (24:02) COVID-19 has impacted our students. Since March, I’ve thought often of these students. Of all the students that I met during my school visits last year and wondered how their lives have changed during this crisis. I have thought especially about the students I met at Chinle High School in the Navajo Nation. During the school day, Chinle’s students have access to amazing opportunities like welding classes that make learning hands on and tangible. During basketball season, as you may have seen on Netflix, thousands of family and community members pack their high school gyms for games. And in the spring, that same gym is transformed into a celebratory space to honor their high school graduates.',\n",
              "  'Kathy Hoffman: (24:52) Chinle’s High School building is much more than a set of classrooms. It is a community gathering space. It is a space to build the skills, minds, and hearts of the next generation. This is why I take so seriously, the opportunity for schools to safely reopen their facilities. It is the reason why I call on Arizonans to mask up, physically distance, and stay home whenever they are able. But I want to be clear that teaching and learning will happen no matter what the next school year looks like in your community. I am thrilled to join governor Ducey here today to share our guarantees on how we will support schools in providing safe instruction and critical services during this next academic year. Thank you.',\n",
              "  'Governor Doug Ducey: (25:43) Thanks very much superintendent. So let’s run through the plan for the next school year. Arizona will be open for learning and our priorities are going to be public health and safety. We’re going to make data driven decisions. There will be parental choice, options for families in different situations, flexibility to our school leaders. And recognizing that the achievement gap and the digital divide are real and do everything we can to reduce and eliminate it. And viewing our schools as our most essential service we provide as we move forward.',\n",
              "  'Governor Doug Ducey: (26:26) Now I also want to thank all the leaders, influencers, and decision makers, superintendents, and the superintendent. This plan was informed by your input. Well, much of the public discussion has been focused on a date certain. The focus needs to be on ensuring that Arizona students have a successful academic year. The goal is to provide our students with rigorous instruction and consistency in learning while prioritizing their health and safety. This is the greatest challenge to public education in our lifetimes. And Arizona has the opportunity to lead the nation and that superintendent Hoffman and my goal to make Arizona a model state in this situation, providing the best learning experience to kids in the safest environment during this crisis.',\n",
              "  'Governor Doug Ducey: (27:27) So 180 days of instruction or equivalent hours will be required this year. There will be options for in-person and distance learning, and there will be teacher led distance learning that must begin by the first date of the academic school year. Children deserve a safe learning environment. This includes kids and especially kids enrolled in free and reduced lunch programs, special education students, English language learners, and foster kids. So our schools must provide free onsite learning and support services while implementing healthy and safe protocols in the required onsite learning. Our decisions will be data-driven with maximum flexibility to local school leaders, recognizing they need public health data to make decisions.',\n",
              "  'Governor Doug Ducey: (28:37) The Arizona department of health services will develop and release public health benchmarks for the safe return of in-person teacher led classroom instruction. Local school leaders will make the determination and consider these recommendations. Face coverings, schools will develop an implement face covering policies. All adults will have a face covering on inside a school. There will be exceptions for students when they can socially distance outside in playground settings, breaks for students to take their masks off in a safe environment and other exceptions outlined by the Centers for Disease Control.',\n",

This will ensure budget stability, recognize additional costs in-person learning we’ll bring to districts in the school year and closing the achievement gap. This has been pointed out by many leaders in K-12 education, how real this was, how it was amplified last year. I want to thank Dr. Chad Gaston of Phoenix Unified for pointing this out in our last visit. $40 million to expand broadband, 20 million to bring in support for high need schools, six million for the teacher’s academy, a million dollars in micro grants to support innovative programs. A million dollars for the school of the deaf and blind. $700,000 for leadership development, 500,000 for tutoring kids from Teach for America. So if you have questions or you want to see more on this, you can go to your school’s website for specifics to your superintendents. This also be up on the superintendent’s website, along with the governor’s website with more to follow',\n",

Switching gears again, around getting tested, talking about the coronavirus. We know people want to get tested, we have prioritized essential workers, symptomatic and sick folks. Today we have tests available. This is CDC surge testing. These sites have been up and running since Friday, to date the wait times have been minimal, and unfortunately the demand has been low. If you look in Maryvale, our task capacity had 28% of the test that’s been administered and in South Phoenix it’s been less. So we want more to get tested at the sites. It’s completely free. There’s no ID required. Centrally located in the Valley and you’ll have the results between 48 and 72 hours. If you need more specific information, go to azhealth.gov/surgetesting. And with that, I want to turn it over to Dr. Cara Christ for a public health update. Dr. Christ.',\n",
              "  'Dr. Cara Christ: (32:22) Thank you Governor. So as just a reminder, to make sure that everybody understands the risks that they are facing when they are leaving their home. We want you to know the risks. You want to ask yourself those questions before going out. So how many people will you interact with? We know that the more people that you interact with, especially in close contact, the higher your risk for transmission of COVID-19. Are you able to physically distance from people that is one of the biggest that will block transmission, if you can keep six feet of space between you and others. And if you’ll be indoors or outdoors. So if you are outdoors, you have more opportunity for physical distancing and you have more opportunity for better ventilation. And then what is the length of time that you’ll be interacting with people? The more time you spend with people, the more transmission of COVID-19 becomes a risk.',\n",
              "  'Dr. Cara Christ: (33:19) So to talk about expanding testing a little bit more ASU will be expanding their saliva based testing sites. These are the free sites that they collect at. They will continue to operate out of the West Valley. We will be adding sites in Pima County, Coconino County, and La Paz County. And then we have been working with additional providers to expand testing or to expand their capacity. And that includes Embry Women’s Health, CVS pharmacies. The federally qualified health centers will be receiving grants to provide testing at their centers. We’re working with a quality health to expand their testing in partnership with CLPC as well as banner has expanded the number of tests that they can perform. And they do have sites that are available.',\n",
              "  'Dr. Cara Christ: (34:12) We’re hearing a lot about the lab turnaround times and how long it is taking those labs to get results back to individuals. And from a public health standpoint, this is a frustrating point because we have a limited time in which we can react. We can do the case investigation and stop further transmission. So to give everyone a little bit of information, we have 28 commercial university or public laboratories that can report to us electronically. We call this ELR, there are other operating labs that do not report electronically. Those are not included in some of the statistics, because we don’t have the insight of when they received it and when they were able to process it and report it. The current statewide turnaround for ELR labs is about 5.2 days, but the individual labs will range from same day to on average seven and a half days.',\n",
              "  'Dr. Cara Christ: (35:11) That’s the time from the collect, to the time that they report get that result. Obviously since 7.5 is an average. We do know that there are days that are longer. We’re getting a lot of questions about the viability of the samples and how long that they can be stored. So they can be refrigerated for several days, between three and five days, depending on what type of media they are in and how they are collected. They can be frozen at your regular freezer temperature. So minus 20 degrees for a week, if you put them at minus 70 or minus 80, which we refer to as a deep freeze, they can be frozen indefinitely and rewarmed, and then tested. The long turnaround times like I said, do impact public health because we want to be able to connect with the people. We want to give them the instructions on how to prevent transmitting COVID-19 to others. And we want to get in touch with their contacts so that we can break that transmission chain.',\n",
              "  'Dr. Cara Christ: (36:10) So over the last few days, we have been working very closely with Sonora Quest, as I’m sure everyone is aware, we have provided them with funding to bring on an additional machine.

Those transfers to those beds will be coordinated through the Arizona surge line. They will be… We are holding those beds on behalf of the state and then working with the provider to fill those beds. We’re continuing to identify additional partners along the whole spectrum of post acute facilities.

              "  'Kathy Hoffman: (01:01:37) For the guidelines as far as for when schools open or close, we’ve already seen many of our governing boards make very difficult decisions about when they want their schools to open. As you’ve seen many of our school districts have already opted that they will not offer in-person instruction until October. We do expect that schools will have different start dates depending on local circumstances, and what we’re going to do, what we’re committed to doing that is in this executive order is creating a framework that identifies the different data points that they can use with their county health officials to determine whether or not schools should be open for in-person instruction.',\n",
              "  'Kathy Hoffman: (01:02:18) There could be scenarios in the future where a school could open for in-person instruction, and then if there happens to be another outbreak in that area they may need to close again. So that is a possibility, and that was actually included in part of our roadmap for reopening schools that we outlined different types of recommendations for different scenarios, and that’s one of the scenarios that we accounted for.',\n",
              "  'Angela: (01:02:41) Okay, thank you. Would that mean that the state would shut down a school or would the school just close their doors on their own? How would that work?',\n",
              "  'Kathy Hoffman: (01:02:49) Our local governing boards have the authority to make that decision. I would expect it would be the local governing boards making a decision in conjunction with their local county health offices.',\n",
              "  'Speaker 3: (01:03:01) We’re going to come back to the room here [inaudible 01:03:03]. I’m going to go to JJ Cooper from AP.',\n",
              "  'JJ Cooper: (01:03:11) Thanks. We’re coming up on the end of summer vacation, and we’re just hearing that it’s going to be another two weeks or so before we get the metrics that schools can use to make these decisions. Why aren’t those available now or sooner given that we’ve known this problem was coming for as long as it’s been out there? And then given the extreme delays in testing and measuring what’s going on in the community how confident are you that those metrics will have reliable, accurate, up-to-date data for the school districts to use?',\n",
              "  'Governor Doug Ducey: (01:03:46) Thanks, JJ, and I think it’s a fair question. There’s a framework that already exists. Things have changed quite a bit in the last four weeks. I think we’ve been able to see that. When we first had our meeting with the Superintendents after the end of last school year all of the preparations were about going back into school in the traditional setting. Through the course of the discussions we’ve really found that we’ve got a very large constituency that no matter what in this setting, and I mean no matter what even back in the beginning they don’t feel comfortable or feel safe and likely do not want to go back into schools until there’s a vaccine.',\n",
              "  'Governor Doug Ducey: (01:04:35) We also have a very large constituency that is ready to go back into school in person tomorrow and not concerned about anything that’s in front of us. And then we also have a very large constituency that has nowhere else to go except to the school. Their parent may be one of our frontline healthcare workers inside the hospital, and they have to go to work. So we’re trying to enhance the guidance, to answer all the questions just like some of the questions that we face today around what if and what happens and what if this scenario happens in a school, what if a student, what if a teacher, what if a classroom, what a cohort. You can really go down one after another. We’re letting the subject matter experts from public instruction and the Department of Health Services along with the Centers for Disease Control do that. What we laid out for you today was that we’re going to have a safe and successful school year in the state of Arizona with flexibility, ample resources, and there will be hybrid options available.',\n",
              "  'JJ Cooper: (01:05:51) For the group that you mentioned that won’t feel comfortable going back to school until there’s a vaccine do you foresee there ever being a point where they are told that they need to go back to school before there’s a vaccine?',\n",
              "  'Governor Doug Ducey: (01:06:02) Arizona has always been a state that’s respected parental choice. And I want to really hand it not only to our leaders and our Superintendents and our teachers, but I think as much as I wish we didn’t have to deal with what happened in the spring I think our state had a leap frog forward in terms of innovations and teachers that have embraced distance learning. And Chad Guston in our last meeting said Phoenix Union and where it is right now has set an objective at least for the first quarter or first semester that they’re going to be the best in the world at distance learning. I think having a kid in a classroom is a great thing. In this situation somebody that’s got an underlying health condition or a weakened immunity we would never force them to do something that would be against their safety, and we would want to provide options for them. Do you have anything to add, Superintendent?',\n",
              "  'Kathy Hoffman: (01:07:09) The only thing I would add is in these conversations over the past couple weeks you asked what changed, so a couple of weeks ago it was more a question of when can our schools open, when can we all open together and get back into the classroom? And at this time we don’t know when that date is. It’s not reasonable to set a date because as you’ve seen what’s happened is then in a couple weeks we might have another press conference like this and set another date. So we really wanted to avoid that type of situation because every single time we have this type of announcement for our schools they’re scrambling to figure out what’s the new policy, what do I need to do now, and communicate that to their parents and families.',\n",
              "  'Kathy Hoffman: (01:07:51) So when we put this executive order together it was really important to us to actually go back to the roadmap and think about all the different scenarios that our schools might face in this upcoming year and be prepared for significant amount of time doing distance learning and give those flexibilities and assurances so that our schools are empowered to go for learning to start, which is what we want. We want them to start connecting with our kids across the state. So I’m back to my optimism that this will be a durable plan that we can use the framework and the public health data rather than setting a date, which could change again.',\n",
              "  'JJ Cooper: (01:08:31) Just really quick, the AP reported yesterday that immigrant children as young as one are being detained in a hotel in Phoenix before they’re sent back to their home countries. This goes around the standard process for unaccompanied minors coming across the border. Do have thoughts on this practice happening in Arizona? Are you comfortable with it?',\n",
              "  'Governor Doug Ducey: (01:08:51) This is the first that I’ve heard of that. I’d have to know the details and the facts before I commented.',\n",
              "  'Speaker 3: (01:08:57) Morgan Lowe from 3 TV next. Morgan, go ahead.',\n",

              "  'Patrick: (01:09:03) Thanks governor. So I’m a little slow. We don’t have a date set now for in person class. Is that accurate? Is there a scenario where it could begin August 17th? Was the target date before?',\n",
              "  'Kathy Hoffman: (01:09:20) I would say at this point it’s unlikely that schools will be ready to start their full in-person instruction on August 17th, but we will have the onsite learning opportunities available that soon. So that will be where schools are developing plans for their at risk student populations or for serving essential workers children. And so there will be continued services starting at that time, but in terms of, we’re not setting a statewide date for when school will start, we’re recreating the framework so that our schools can make data informed decisions.',\n",
              "  'Governor Doug Ducey: (01:09:54) Okay. And I also want to say Morgan, if I can, because there’s been a couple of questions around the date. The date was something that the superintendent and I were using to make announcements about what was happening. But school in Arizona has never started on a certain date. We’ve had all kinds of flexibility and option from schools that go through the summer that take fall break. And this differs really by governing board and by region in the state. So the idea around the date is we wanted to pull that off the table and give the guidelines where the things that people love about Arizona education, the flexibility, the parental choice, and the additional resources while allowing the people that know how to get it done and get it done best at the local level to have those flexibilities.',\n",
              "  'Patrick: (01:10:50) And second part of this question. Aside from making sure they have a safe and healthy learning environment, we are taking potentially 400,000 to 800,000 people who have been on lockdown for four months and we are going to put them back into the environment. They’re going to be around each other, potentially, depending on how many are in person. Is part of this process of getting it ready figuring out how we’re going to deal with potentially another big spike in cases? Because this has been a protected population. Now they’re going to be out there. Are you concerned that we’re going to see a big spike regardless of how careful schools are?',\n",
              "  'Governor Doug Ducey: (01:11:41) Do you want to talk about that from a public health perspective and the situation that children are in versus are vulnerable, please?',\n",
              "  'Dr. Cara Christ: (01:11:51) Sure. Governor, so Morgan, when we look at bringing back any kind of group, we do expect to see some transmission of COVID. One of the biggest things that we have been planning for this entire time has been the upcoming influenza season, because we know that that’s also going to cause a spike. What the data is currently showing is that kids under 10 don’t transmit COVID as effectively as adults do. So that would limit that as we’re watching what’s going on with daycares that have been operating, as we’ve been watching around what’s been going on around the world, so that will have less of an impact, but we will continue to monitor. And there will be benchmarks that we will look at to determine if it does look like it’s increasing and we’ll be monitoring all of those metrics that the governor pointed out.',\n",
              "  'Patrick: (01:12:39) And then just really just one final thing. We are changing the way kids are going to be learning at Somerton. And Hoffman, are you concerned that our state of children aren’t going to get the education this year that they would have gotten a year ago?',\n",
              "  'Kathy Hoffman: (01:12:58) Yes, the story I mentioned about Chinley High School students, when they go to school, they have the opportunity for welding, for chemistry, for music, all these opportunities that kids do not have at home, which is why it’s our shared goal to get to a point where schools will open and we’re not there yet. And so every day that our schools are not fully open and serving students in the way where they have wraparound supports is a setback for us academically and for social services and all the services that our schools provide.',\n",
              "  'Kathy Hoffman: (01:13:29) So I want to acknowledge that our educators are going above and beyond to design completely a complete new system of online and distance learning. And they’re doing everything they can to connect with kids and families, whether that’s calling them or online conference, the video conferencing and doing everything they can to connect with their families. But it’s never going to be the same as having all kids coming into a classroom and having all the opportunities that our schools provide. And we know there’s differences in family resources. So some of our families don’t have internet. Don’t have computer skills. Don’t maybe have parents that don’t speak English. There’s just completely different types of home situations that I am very concerned about.',\n",
              "  'Governor Doug Ducey: (01:14:14) Morgan, I would add to the question, am I concerned about our kids and the education they’re going to receive this year? Of course. That’s why we’re working so hard. I’m putting a plan as the superintendent said, that is durable regardless of what is in front of us, so that we can maximize our children’s education, make it as successful and safe as possible. I am confident that our kids did not get that experience last year. I think our teachers did everything they possibly could getting thrown the curve ball that came their way. But our kids have some makeup to do through no fault of their own, likely around math and reading and other things. And the other question was, am I concerned about a spike in the future? And of course, that’s why we begin every day with the numbers, we close every day with the numbers, we’re being so vigilant around this.',\n",
              "  'Governor Doug Ducey: (01:15:17) I think the challenges that we have in Arizona aren’t all that much different than pretty much any other state in the country. And this is where it really is on leaders and local leaders and teachers and parents and superintendents to be innovative and creative and flexible in figuring this out. And that’s how the plan was written to not only provide the best that we could put together, but to allow others to add to that plan, to make it better, and then to share those best practices across the state and across the country.',\n",

              "  'Ben Giles: (01:16:02) All right. Thank you all. Two quick questions. First, we’ve talked a lot about guidelines for schools to return to in-person learning situations. Are there going to be guidelines for what happens if there is a spread of COVID in a school? Guidelines for how to pull the plug and how to operate if things go haywire.',\n",
              "  'Dr. Cara Christ: (01:16:25) Yes. So that will be part of that. They’ll work with their local county health departments. So county health departments are always working with their schools in influenza season, when there are outbreaks of disease, there will be guidelines around that.',\n",
              "  'Speaker 5: (01:16:46) Ben did you have one more?',\n",
              "  'Ben Giles: (01:16:49) Yes. Governor, you also talked about a discouraging statistic that it seems the demand for testing has gone down, even as you’ve worked with state officials and other private organizations to expand testing opportunities. I want to open this question to Dr. Christ as well. What do you attribute to the lower demand and how maybe can you inspire confidence in Arizonans to go out there and get tested?',\n",
              "  'Governor Doug Ducey: (01:17:20) Well, I’d be speculating, but I think it could be a number of things. One, testing has been a huge challenge in Arizona. The testing in terms of supply chain and national resources was really going to many other places because the other places were the hot spots for so long. Arizona was really not in harm’s way, writ large, the way the Eastern seaboard was for March and April and May and June. As we began to have our increase in cases and increase in testing, a lot of our wait times went longer, and we’ve worked very hard to make it more convenient for people to get a test.',\n",
              "  'Governor Doug Ducey: (01:18:07) And then in addition, sometimes the return has been too long. So we think that we’ve addressed each of those in their turn. They remain a challenge. And I think oftentimes when cases are spiking and it may be more topical in the news, there’s more demand from people that don’t feel sick or symptomatic. And we’ve had a couple of weeks of improving numbers and it’s taken away some of that demand. And we want to find a way that we can get more people tested, people that are feeling sick or symptomatic or in a vulnerable situation or a frontline worker. We’re going to prioritize tests for them. But we want the curious now to also be tested. It’s one way that we think we’ll be able to further open our economy, make better decisions about things that you get involved in. And we’re also quite certain that it will lower our positivity score as well. Dr. Christ.',\n",
              "  'Dr. Cara Christ: (01:19:07) That was perfect. I think I agree with everything you said.',\n",

              "  'Josh: (01:19:18) Governor and Dr. Christ. With respect to the present positive number, the seven day average for the state is around 24%, a 30 day average, 25%. That’s leading the nation. That number problematic for experts, because again, it shows that there’s widespread community being impacted by the virus. Wouldn’t that number alone cause you pause and have you press the brake on reopening businesses in general and possibly even shutting down the state again?',\n",
              "  'Governor Doug Ducey: (01:19:53) Well, we look at the number over the course of time. Like I said, we have been prioritizing people that are sick, symptomatic and working in these settings. We’re confident yesterday’s test, the previous week’s test, what we’ve seen in terms of the trend, that we’re making responsible, incremental decisions. And we have shut some things down that have been the CDCs recommendation. Of course we don’t want to do that. We felt that that was necessary in which to do that. And then the fact that we can expand testing logically, you should see a decrease in terms of positivity and much of what we’re talking about is still several weeks out. So oftentimes we have folks come in and say, “Why aren’t you letting us know further in advance?” I mean, this has been a dynamic and fluid situation. It’s changed. It’ll continue to change. Do you have anything more?',\n",
              "  'Josh: (01:20:53) Well, just to add to that though, again, that number being problematic and you look over the last 30 days leading the country when it comes to a 25% positive rate. So Dr. Christ, knowing, as an expert, and knowing that number, how has that played into the decisions that you’ve made and the conversations that you guys are having across industrial platforms, including education?',\n",
              "  'Dr. Cara Christ: (01:21:17) So we are looking at the percent positivity, like I said, we are looking at it from the previous weeks. So as the percent positivity is reported, you want it reported against the timeframe that it was actually taken, not the time that it’s reported to the health department. And so that may be one of the difference between the seven day moving average, as well as like what you see on our website. So we are monitoring that, that is a very important factor. And one of the reasons that we made the recommendation not to reopen the bars and not to reopen some of those businesses that had closed down, that was also the recommendation for why we wanted to have the benchmarks so that schools could feel comfortable. We’re not recommending that they open next week. We know that we will have the data that should be on the backlog, should be cleared by the 31st. So we should have all available data. We’ll be able to use that as we develop the benchmarks and our local health departments and our local schools can make that decision.',\n",

We do tend to see increased illness when kids returned to school. That just is part of what happens. And so we would expect to see that same type of phenomenon. That doesn’t make your immune system react any differently. It’s just that you’re exposed to different antigens.',\n",

My assessment of what’s happened is if we look at the outbreak in Navajo Nation and the way things have plateaued, it’s as the governor has said many times, it’s not time to declare victory. We find in a myriad of locations where there’s, especially on our tribal nations, 22 of them here in the state, that the nature of multi-generational homes is one of the primary factors for a continued spread. So we appreciate the partnership of the three tribes that we’ve worked with most recently, White Mountain, Apache, Tohono O’odham and Pascua Yaqui. We’ve put resources there. I appreciate your question. We’re going to continue to do a resourcing blitzes. Tohono O’odham has asked for another testing blitz next week, which we’ll support and we continue to try to do that.

I mean, at that point, contact tracing is almost useless.',\n",

If we don’t have a better turnaround time, that’s why we’ve provided resources to our private providers. We need faster turnaround time. If you go to the two sites that are available right now, you do get a faster turnaround and that’s the best and only way for contact tracing to be effective. And that’s of course what we want.',\n",

The News was an important link that connected new Jersey’s diverse Jewish communities and which strengthened the bond between our state and the one hand and the state of Israel on the other. And I want to give a shout out to our friend ambassador, Dani Dayan. His last day as Israel’s console general in New York, including service to New Jersey, is today. And we wish him the very best and thank him for his extraordinary partnership over the past two and a half years during our time here.',\n",
              "  'Governor Phil Murphy: (02:32) The Jewish News predates the creation of Israel and has covered the news honestly, and transparently across it’s nearly seven and a half decade run. the News has fought against the increasing incidents of antisemitism and intolerance across our state. When I took my first international economic mission as governor, I made sure it included a stop in Israel, a key trading and business partner. And, as always, the Jewish News was there to cover it. So, to all the reporters and editors who, over the years, have put out the paper edition, New Jersey Jewish News, every Shabbat, thank you. And I hope the news will continue in an online format. You are all a vital part of a vital force for the good, a vital voice and force for the good.',\n",
              "  'Governor Phil Murphy: (03:18) Next, I must note, I would be remiss if I did not, that Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, sent the Senate home for a long weekend without taking any action on a long list of items, but especially to renew unemployment, federal unemployment benefits that have now expired for millions of families here in New Jersey and many more millions nationwide. With millions of families literally left hanging, to simply go home for a long weekend is the ultimate act of irresponsible behavior and dereliction of duty. Senator McConnell, please, get back to Washington and get this done. Families across our state, and indeed, across the nation, are facing literally an economic meltdown on your watch. And this is no time to take a weekend, nevermind a long weekend off. Despicable.',\n",

Every day, we receive a summary from Ed and his team at the Communicable Disease Service, which provides a detailed overview of cases and data pertaining to hospitalizations and deaths. That data will now be put in a more interactive and easy to navigate form. The dashboard available at COVID-19.nj.gov will provide statewide and county level trends in COVID-19 confirmed cases, deaths, and hospitalizations over time.',\n",
              "  'Governor Phil Murphy: (05:04) We are posting the percent positivity by region and by date. And the number of cases can now be viewed by the date of illness onset. The breakdowns by race and ethnicity are given greater clarity. And we are also posting the complete curve of confirmed cases by date of death, as well as the dates of the deaths we currently have listed as probable. Throughout this pandemic, we have occasionally made tweaks to the way we present data to provide greater context or clarity. And today’s upgrades to the dashboard continue that work. And I must thank Judy, and Ed, and their teams for their ongoing efforts.',\n",
              "  'Governor Phil Murphy: (05:44) So, if you go to the dashboard, you will see that we are today reporting an additional 699 positive test results, pushing the total number of cases of Coronavirus in New Jersey since March 4th to 181,660. Before I move on, I’d like to note that, even with the increases we have seen in the latest case numbers, New Jersey remains among the ten states nationwide with the lowest number of active cases per capita. I want to warn you in advance. You’re going to get on the one hand on the other hand today. Because the other hand we’re going to be pretty tough on it as well.',\n",

That is also not quite as good as it’s been, but that’s pretty darn good. We have continued to increase our volume of testing over the past couple of weeks. And, as a result, we remain among the five states with the lowest daily percent positivity. Again, one of the top ten cases in lowest number of active cases per capita. And we remain among, to repeat, the five states with the lowest daily percent positivity.',\n",

It’s too uneven. And, for the most part, it’s too long. And we had a good call with John.',\n",
              "  'Governor Phil Murphy: (07:18) Side by side With that, we also continue ramping up our contact tracing capabilities and working with local health departments to identify causes of outbreaks that have contributed to recent increases in our cases. And Judy and I will have more on that next week, both I would bet technologically, but also an update here in person. However, the increases in new cases we have seen over the past week has pushed the statewide rate of transmission to 1.35. And, given the recent data on cases, we anticipate, unfortunately, that it will go higher in the days ahead.',\n",
              "  'Governor Phil Murphy: (07:56) So, here’s on the other hand. Look, the numbers are setting off alarms that we are taking and we take very seriously. We still may be among the leaders in having the lower case numbers and daily positivity rates. We don’t take that for granted, but we are standing in a very dangerous place. As I said, the alarms are going off. The only way to silence these alarms and get back to the process of moving forward is for everyone to take them seriously, not just most of you, but all of you, all of us. We are not past this. Everyone who walks around refusing to wear a mask, or who hosts an indoor house party, or who over stuffs a boat is directly contributing to these increases. This has to stop and it has to stop now.',\n",

Meaning, if your capacity is, say, 100, then you can have no more than 25 people inside. It’s the lesser of 25% or 100 individuals. And I want to reiterate that I and we reserve the right to lower this threshold if necessary to protect public health. I’m not anticipating or announcing, I should say, any specific action today. But consider this as being put on notice. We will not tolerate these devil may care, nonchalant attitudes any longer. Pat is going to have a couple of specific comments on compliance. And he’s got one thing in particular that relates to indoors that he will hit hard. And I will be happy to come in behind you and hit hard as well.',\n",
              "  'Governor Phil Murphy: (09:42) Now, back to the data. And I’ll look at yesterday’s report from our hospitals. As of last night, there were 352 COVID confirmed patients being treated with an additional 343, Judy, persons under investigation, pending the return of their test results. That’s a total of 695 hospitalizations. Of those, 113 required intensive care and 45 ventilators were in use. Overall, the trends in our hospitals continue to move our healthcare system in the right direction. And, as these numbers keep moving down, so do we in the national rankings and the important healthcare metrics.',\n",
              "  'Governor Phil Murphy: (10:21) Sadly, however, we continue to lose members of our extraordinary New Jersey family to COVID-19. And today we must report another ten confirmed deaths and losses of blessed lives. Of these, Judy, you and I talked about this earlier, seven occurred in the past five days. And three of those were on July 27, the only day with more than one confirmed death of late. This is a big deal. And I know Judy is going to want to come in behind this as well.',\n",

That is the first day that we can say that that is the case since March 10th, 142 days ago, almost five months ago. And you’ve asked us, folks, will we get one of those days? And we said, we’d get it. We just didn’t know when. It was the 24 hours that ended last night. So, I think we’re all going to just take a quick moment and reflect on that again. The first day we can say that since March ten.',\n",
              "  'Governor Phil Murphy: (11:46) Well, this is an extraordinary milestone. Let me just remind folks, and Judy and Ed, correct me if you think I’m wrong about this, I’m going to say about a month ago is about when you would have been plus or minus infected. And I know there’s some that were a lot longer and some that were shorter that would have led to a death around now. If you look at the number of positives that we were reporting at the end of June, as we are in the end of July, it was averaging about 350 a day. There were a couple of days higher and there were a couple of days lower in that last week of June. This past week, the average, eye balling it, and again, a big number today, a somewhat lesser number yesterday, let’s smooth that out, is averaging about 550. So, let’s just remember deaths or lack of deaths, thank God, in this case, reflect positive cases. This is a lagging indicator of what we were seeing. And again, I’m simplifying about a month ago, about 350 a day of positive cases. This past week, 550 a day of positive cases.',\n",
              "  'Governor Phil Murphy: (12:55) So, not only do we commemorate, reflect, and celebrate zero deaths in our hospitals over the past 24 hours, we have to also acknowledge the number of positive cases is meaningfully higher right now on average than it was a month ago. The total number of lost lives that are confirmed, lab confirmed 13,944. And the number of probable deaths remains at 1,875. As we do every day, let’s recall three more of the blessed members of our New Jersey family who we have lost. We begin by remembering Dominick on the left and Shirley on the right D’Stefan of Florham Park, which they called home for 65 years. D’Stefan, their family walked me through this, Dominick’s ancestors came from Italy. Their name was in fact DiStefano. But, in the lost in translation reality of Ellis Island, the eye behind the D got flipped into an apostrophe and the O at the end of DiStefano got dropped. So, they are D’Stefan, the proudly Italian Americans. Dominick was born in the Chambersburg section of Trenton in the house, by the way, that his father, a mason, built by hand. And I think it was his dad who was the one who came over and immigrated as first generation.',\n",

From that posting, he developed a lifelong interest in electronics. After the war, he earned a degree in electrical engineering under the GI Bill from Temple University. But his budding career in the field was short circuited when he was recalled to the Navy to serve during the Korean War. After his second tour of duty, Dominick earned his masters in management sciences from the Stevens Institute of Technology and began a career with Bell Labs where he would work on the Telstar project, the first successful transmission of a radio wave to a target in space and back. But more importantly-',\n",

Upon his retirement from AT&7, he began a career teaching mathematics and engineering at the County College of Morris, retiring in his 80s. Dominic had a lifelong love of music and was an accomplished trumpeter and trombonist, a member, by the way, of the Musicians Union. He played in orchestras, as well as in major parades. His favorite song, as was my late father’s favorite song, was Hoagy Carmichael’s American classic, Stardust. I’m dating myself. Just one week after Dominick passed, Shirley too lost her battle with COVID-19.',\n",
              "  'Governor Phil Murphy: (15:43) Shirley was born in Carney, attended Carny High School and Uppsala college and, as we know now, she also started working at Bell Labs. After their marriage, Shirley and Dominick, by the way, she called him Dom, they settled in Florham Park to raise their daughter, Donna. Shirley would go back to work as a school bus driver for the Florham Park Board of Education and became a beloved fixture in the life of the community and in the lives of the thousands of children she transported to and from school. She knew where each one lived, what their likes were and recalling something special about their personalities. After hanging up her bus keys, Shirley took an active interest in gardening and birdwatching, making the weekly trip to Agway on Senior Citizens Tuesday for various bird seeds and treats for her feathered friends. She loved all animals and never minded when the neighborhood deer stopped by to snack on the seeds she put out. She loved to sew and bake pies and to travel the world.',\n",

When they passed, he was 92 and she was 90. They leave behind, as I mentioned, their daughter, Donna, and her husband, Dennis, and I had the honor to speak with both of them. So as we send them off, I want to quote Hoagy Carmichael and say, “Though I dream in vain, in my heart it will remain my stardust melody, the memory of love’s refrain.” May God bless them both. We thank Dominick for his years of service to our nation.',\n",

Jack served in the US Air Force and earned a bachelor of science and ornamental horticulture from the University of Tennessee, then came to New Jersey to earn his master of science and environmental science in urban planning from Rutgers University.

This morning, the news broke that the Census Bureau will be ending its door-to-door efforts one month earlier than originally planned, on September 30th, meaning that we need you to make sure you are counted now. We cannot overstate the importance of an accurate count of all New Jerseyans in the census. It’s about protecting $45 billion every year in aid for our schools, our health care facilities and our communities. That’s $450 billion over a decade, if you’re counting at home. It’s about making sure every family has healthy food to eat and that our roads and transit systems are funded. It’s about making sure that we have what we need to rebound from this pandemic. It’s about making sure we get back every dollar from Washington that we deserve. So far, roughly two and a half million households, or 64.7% of all New Jersey households, have already responded to the census. That’s a good number, but right now we’re only good enough to rank 21st among all states in responding. We need everyone to be counted.',\n",

Please take time to go to 2020census.gov today to make sure you and your family are counted, then reach out to your friends and neighbors and make sure they are too. We know New Jersey was under counted in 2010 and because of that, we have lost out on literally billions and billions of dollars of extra federal funds over the past decade. And the news that the Census Bureau will stop its direct outreach one month early means that unless you do your civic duty, we will be counted again in. An under-count will almost certainly mean, especially, that our communities of color will be left out. There will be hundreds of activities across the state this weekend to push residents to get counted. You could find one near you, by the way, going to census.nj.gov. Census.nj.gov. Communities across the state have challenged each other to see who can outperform the other. Let’s all be a part of the census, let’s show how strong New Jersey is by getting counted today.

We know this pandemic has been nothing short of an economic crisis as much as it has been a public health crisis, and that is why I am proud of the work of the New Jersey economic development authority to pump $100 million directly into our small business sector. One of those small businesses we’re proud to have partnered with is Joy’s Hallmark of Marlton, owned by Ron and joy Monokian. They’ve been in business since 1987, helping their customers celebrate holidays, birthdays, weddings, graduations, and frankly, everything else in between. But when the pandemic hit, their store took a hit too.

He’s also, by the way, a member of both the Burlington and Ocean City Chambers of Commerce, and I share his support of all the small business owners who have been working hard to keep their dreams alive throughout this pandemic. We’re going to get through this together and we’re going to come out stronger together.

As we journey through this pandemic together, there is no group that is more important than our local health officials. Throughout this pandemic, local health departments have been working around the clock to prepare, respond to and contain the spread of COVID-19. Earlier this year, the department allocated $5 million in federal funding to support the local health departments to carry out critical local public health efforts, such as investigating positive cases, contact tracing, providing guidance to longterm care facilities, standing up community testing sites, ensuring individuals have a safe place to quarantine and a variety of other COVID-19 related activities.',\n",
              "  'Judith Persichilli: (27:20) Today, we are further investing in the public health infrastructure by making $32.3 million in federal funding available to county and local health departments. 13.7 million of the CDC funding will be allocated to health departments in each of the 21 counties and the city of Newark, which are responsible for preparedness coordination in their jurisdictions. These 22 health departments are known as LINCS agencies. LINCS stands for local information network and communications systems. This funding will allow these agencies to hire additional employees to coordinate testing, contact tracing and isolation and quarantine activities in their communities in collaboration with the 99 local health departments. These new positions will provide data management and epidemiological support to all local health departments and contact tracing teams within their areas. They’ll help individuals exposed to COVID with the needs such as housing, food, mental health and medical services and other social supports. And they will ensure testing, contact tracing, isolation and quarantine, and social support services are conducted in a timely and complete manner.',\n",

These funds will be disbursed over a two-year period and will provide health departments with more resources to identify, track and respond to local outbreaks quickly. There is still much that we don’t know about this virus, but we continue to learn something every day, and this week the CDC released data on the clinical course and recovery for individuals with milder illness. Their findings indicate that even among symptomatic adults tested in outpatient settings, it might take weeks for resolution of symptoms and return to usual health. One third of those individuals surveyed had not returned to usual health within two to three weeks of testing. And they found that one in five previously healthy young individuals, 18 to-',\n",
              "  'Judith Persichilli: (30:03) Previously healthy young individuals, 18 to 34 years of age, weren’t back to usual health in two to three weeks after testing positive. This lingering illness may lead to prolonged absences from work studies or other activities. So researchers are beginning to study the longer term effects of COVID-19. And some studies have indicated that the virus can damage the heart. In addition, there are many anecdotal stories of individuals that had the illness who are still struggling with fatigue and difficulty breathing months later. This should be a sobering reminder to healthy residents, especially young individuals that this disease is serious. You could be battling cough, fatigue, or shortness of breath for weeks or months. Again, there are still a lot we don’t know about the disease and its health effects, so it is not worth taking unnecessary risks.

Fortunately, no new reports of multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children. Our total remains at 54. The ages of the children affected range from one to 18. At this point, none of these children are currently hospitalized. The governor reviewed the new cases and deaths. The race ethnicity breakdown is as follows, white 54%, black 18.3, Hispanic 20. 3, Asian 5.5, and other 1.8. All of the 10 newly reported deaths occurred in July. As the governor mentioned, seven of the 10 occurred in the last five days. Our hospitals reported as of 10:00 PM last night for the prior 24 hour period, no deaths for the first time since March.

I want to thank Ed. He is the developer of the dashboard, to provide more context about how COVID-19 unfolded in our state and our counties. Under the tab titled case summary, you can view the trends the governor mentioned. You can also select individual dates and date ranges to see the data more granularly. We are adding data on age adjusted case and mortality rates by race and ethnicity, which allows for a fair comparison between the groups with different age distributions. And earlier this week, we posted a new tab with hospital discharge data broken down by age, gender, race, and ethnicity. That concludes my daily report.

I have begun to get read in more recently, more anecdotal than science- based, a friend Bill Leferett up in Mahwah first raised with me a number of weeks ago, this whole notion of what they’re now calling long haulers as in long haul truckers, but this reality of the lingering health challenges. I mentioned the Red Sox earlier. They’ve got a pitcher right now who’s got an inflamed heart muscle in his heart, but he tested negative now after having tested positive weeks ago. There’s fatigue you mentioned, whole range of challenges, many of which we probably don’t know yet. To your very good point, that creates another health challenge that we’re going to have to collectively deal with obviously, because we’re going to be there for those people. But it’s another reminder that once you get sucked in by this, it could linger in your system, in your body for a long time. So the consequences may God forbid are not life and death, but as we’ve seen with thousands and thousands of folks who have lost their lives, it is an addition to that, you may get through this as most people do, but you may bring with you health realities that could go on for a long time. So thank you for highlighting that. Pat, tropical storm is on our list, which is not COVID, but that’s something that would potentially complicate our lives.

And lastly, on the eviction moratorium, obviously tenants are struggling to pay their rent, but then on the flip side, you have a lot of landlords who haven’t collected rent in six months.

Not only did they walk away off the bridge of the ship in the Senate, leaving individuals hanging who are barely hanging on by a thread, but you’ve got states all over the country that are barely hanging on by a thread. I think on the educators’ side, by the way, we had a good meeting with some of the leadership and the educators, our team, and their team yesterday. And the districts are in the last stages of putting their plans together. I think we’ll leave that to the district plans and see what they have and what they are actually planning.

And one of the ways that we wanted to give relief, not just to parents to give them flexibility and kids at districts, but also as explicitly to educators and that task was to give that remote learning flexibility and option, particularly when we found the resources to close the digital divide. And so that is indirectly not just helping the family and kids where that makes sense, but it’s also helping the educators by lowering capacity. Yeah. I asked the governor last night. The moratorium Matt Plackin is with us, I think will last up to as I recall two months after I declare an end to the health emergency number one, and number two, symmetry has been at the core of a lot of the rental and mortgage holidays and windows that we’ve created.',\n",

And that symmetry is still at the center of all of the windows that we’ve created. What we don’t want, I was asked this last night, people playing games and going circuitous only through one legal avenue when they know that that has a higher chance of being able to circuit our executive order or secondly, that on day one, following the end of the window whether you’re a renter or you have a mortgage or you’re a mortgage payer, we don’t want and don’t expect that you’re going to have a lump sum payment to make on day one of that post holiday period.',\n",

And for me, for yourself and the commissioner, can you sort of walk us through what would happen if the Rt… If the hospitalization rates increased, if the alarms continue and they keep increasing, what could you envision changing or walking back first, whether it’s outdoor dining or gathering capacity? And what are those red lines for you? Is the Rt above a certain number? Is it anything along those particular lines? And finally, just for the governor, if you had a chance to have a conversation with a parent who’s concerned about sending his or her child back to in-person education in the fall because of COVID, what would you say to that parent, not as the governor but as the father of four children?',\n",

Just as indoor dining, I think… I don’t want to put words in your mouth, but we’ve talked for weeks now about having indoor dining, all the capacity, restrictions, social distancing, hyper hygiene, and liquors… Bar service only to the table as opposed to any gathering around the bar. So, yes, the answer is, when we do get there on gyms, and I say, when we’ll get there, we’ll get there on indoor dining, it will be with some restrictions.',\n",

We frankly don’t see a whole lot coming from that second reality. It’s… We’re still getting our arms around that, because we’re asking a lot of individuals. It is overwhelmingly, though, indoor activity, high congregation, lack of ventilation. What I would say as a parent or to a parent, and I am a parent, is, a couple of things I’ve already said but I want to repeat because it’s a very good question, don’t expect a normal school year. And I think if you’ve got that expectation, you’re going to be disappointed. This is going to be unusual.

Thirdly, remember that we have three big principles. Number one, health. Number two, best education possible. Number three, equity. And that gets to a point it depends on who the parent is. Is it a home with an extra room for the kid to easily remote learn, multiple devices? Not both parents aren’t working so they don’t have to worry about putting their living at risk or the daycare challenges that would come from having a child at home. Remember that, on the other hand, there are households, whether it’s… There are two working parents or a single mom or dad, or the circumstances of their density of their living, where the in-person option is the only option. That there’s really… Any plan B is a poor… Either doesn’t exist or it’s a poor substitute for the in-person piece. And I would say, lastly, that we will do it working with the districts, and they’ve done an extraordinary job. We’ll do it as responsibly as possible. So that if you’re in the school, you’re going to see social distancing enforced, face masks and coverings enforced, hyper hygiene, limitations on capacity. However they get there in that district… It depends on the district, because as I’ve said, there’s no two districts alike.

After my remarks Dr. Harris will provide the latest COVID-19 numbers of Alabama, as well as where we are in our efforts to try to contain this disease by reducing its transmission, treat it the best we can, and hopefully get this virus behind us one day in our rear view mirror.

Since his death so much has been written and said about Congressman Lewis, it’d be hard to add much more to his incredible story and his truly inspirational life. But I, for one, was very pleased that our state led the nation in giving Congressman Lewis and appropriate and, I think, a very fitting sendoff for a life well lived and a true example of service above self. Whether it was when his horse drawn carriage paused atop the Edmund Pettus Bridge, resting on the red rose petals that contrasted with his own blood that was shed some 55 years ago, or having our state’s troopers stand and salute as the Congressman passed over the bridge for one final time, Alabamians came from all parts of the state to pay their final respects to this proud son of Alabama, native of Troy.',\n",

And there is such a fine balance, as we have discussed countless times, in factoring both the human health as well as economic health into the equation. And as I’ve said before, my administration and I have made our share of mistakes during this pandemic, but our goal has always been to make more good decisions than bad, hopefully leading to more positive results along the way. As for today’s new order, this would include extending our statewide mask ordinance through August 31st.

And speaking of our schools, I want to encourage every superintendent, every principal, every teacher, and every parent who’s listening, we don’t have the luxury of not getting our young people back in school.

Now, while a majority of safer at home order will remain the same, there’s one addition to this order that will impact those schools providing in class instruction. They will now be required to wear a mask whenever practical, from second grade through college. We know that with all the responsibilities of being a teacher, that this can be an added burden to require that a mask be worn.

If we want our schools to minimize the number of cases they have and minimize outbreaks and the risk of closing again, we really need people to cooperate with continuing to wear face coverings. It’s really more important now than ever. We still have several months to go, at least, I think in this outbreak. And we know we’ll get through it on the other side eventually, but we all need to work together and cooperate and pull together in order to do so. Thank you very much, Governor Ivey.',\n",

The numbers going up is certainly of concern, but also it really matters how hospitals are able to handle that. Right now they are managing the handle that surge. They have ways of creating that space internally. They certainly always have the ability to limit the elective things done in hospitals that they need to create space. We’ve talked to many of them about considering doing that. We have continued to work with hospitals about the possibility of setting up alternate care sites as well, which would be sort of pop up hospitals outside of the usual hospital setting.',\n",

The Port Authority does, among other things, the administration of the airports, building the new John F. Kennedy, rebuilding JFK. So he’s been doing double duty. And we have a great announcement today that we joined in this morning, which I’m going to chat about in a moment.',\n",

It is a new low since we were in the midst of the battle. So, that is great news. Number of COVID patients in ICU, 136. Also a new low since the height of the crisis. Number of intubations, 62. Also a new low. So, that’s great news. Number of lives lost, a new low on the three day average. Three people passed away yesterday. So this is really all great, great news. And I congratulate New Yorkers, because this is purely a result of the actions that they’ve been taking.',\n",
              "  'Andrew Cuomo: (01:32) The progress is even better than we expected. Remember when we started reopening, all the experts said, “Expect the infection rate to increase when the activity rate increases.” That’s what you’ve seen all across the country. That’s what you’ve seen in other countries. And that’s what we expected here. We then were talking about calibrating the increase and making sure it didn’t go that high, but it was supposed to go up. After two, two and a half months of reopening, the numbers have actually gone down, which nobody suggested. And that is really to compliment New Yorkers. We started reopening May 15th. That’s where it was on the curve. You call it a curve. I call it a descent of the mountain. We get to the same place. We just have different metaphorical images. But that’s where the reopening started.',\n",

Well, why shouldn’t we be celebrating? Because look around, that’s why. Look at what’s going on across the country. Look at those increases. Look at what we’re dealing with in terms of now 39 States on the quarantine list, and look at incidents of lack of compliance. The numbers are a result of the actions, and we have been disciplined and we have to stay disciplined. In terms of enforcement, local governments have to do a better job. I don’t know how else to say it. We’re doing everything we can on the state side, the SLA and the state police are working double duty. We have a problem with young people and lack of compliance. We have a problem, especially at bars and restaurants.',\n",

All this to say to the bars and restaurants, follow the rules. Because if you don’t follow the rules, chances are, likelihood is someone’s going to be there to watch and to check. And that’s the way it should be. If you’re following the rules, fine. If you’re not following the rules, if I were you, I would be worried. And that’s the way it should be. We’re seeing continued situations that are just not intelligent, and local governments have to crack down on these, whether they’re in New York city or Long Island, or they’re in upstate New York. How a charter boat could put together a crowd on deck and leave. It’s just disrespectful. It’s illegal. It not only violates public health, it violates common decency. Look at all the people you endangered. What if one of those people on that cruise gets sick and dies? What if the one of those people on that cruise get sick and goes home and gives it to a parent who dies. I mean, it is just really reckless, rude, irresponsible, and illegal. Under the [inaudible 00:05:33] bridge, apparently dozens of people partying. We need better enforcement, all across the state. On the issue of schools, I want to be clear. We have 700 school districts in this state. The districts are putting in plans on how they will handle the reopening. I’ll make a determination later this week on the infection rate, whether or not we’re going to reopen schools. But just because a district puts out a plan, doesn’t mean that if we reopen the school, parents are going to come or teachers are going to come. It’s not, “Well, the government said the schools are open. Now everybody must go.” It’s not going to happen that way. I’m talking to parents. I am telling you it is not going to happen that way. They are not going to trust the school district. This is an issue of public health. Just because the school district says you shouldn’t worry about your child’s public health, that’s not going to be enough. Not in this environment. Not when you’re dealing with situations that everybody knows that nobody has the facts.',\n",

I’ll tell you what they’re going to ask every school district. How are you going to test? How many tests are you going to take? Are you sure you have them lined up? Are you sure those are enough tests? Is it a representative sample? How long is it going to take to turn around the tests? Is it two days, four days, seven days? They’re informed parents. They’re the most informed people on this issue, probably in the country. They’ve lived through it. They’re going to have questions. This is not going to be the school district puts out a plan, and then by Fiat, by dictatorship, that is the plan.',\n",

And there’s going to have to be a discussion. You look at some of these plans, they’re indecipherable. Even if you can understand the plan, they raise questions. And parents are going to need to talk it through. I encourage every school district, set up a discussion room now. Start explaining to the parents now. Have those conversations now. You can’t call people into a conference room, but you can invite them onto a video chat or onto a chat room. But they have questions and they need answers. And time is short. That should start now, because the parents are going to make the decision. Nobody’s going to tell them me whether or not I should send my child to school. I’m going to make that determination. And I’m going to want to make sure it’s an informed determination. And I’m not going to trust just what’s on some school districts plan. I’m not going to do that. And parents have to be comfortable, and they should be comfortable because they are the ultimate decision makers here.',\n",

Just because of the school district says, “We have a safe plan.” I’m telling you, it’s not going to work. They have to feel comfortable, which means they have to be part of the process. We have to have a dialogue. I want to congratulate the Port Authority, Rick Cotton, who runs it. Chairman Kevin O’Toole. The Saint Nicholas Greek church has been a long saga for New York. Was destroyed in 9/11. It was supposed to be rebuilt. There were fits and starts. Bureaucracy was slow. This was slow. But I was just with his Eminence, the Archbishop, and it is now being rebuilt.

It is a spiritual place. And we’ve been trying to get it done for a long time. Sometimes God works in funny ways that it is now being rebuilt at this moment, all these years after 9/11. Why this moment? Maybe because God says he needs or wants a symbol of renewal and rebirth at this moment. Maybe it was God’s way of saying to New Yorkers, yes, this is a tough time. Yes, we’ve been dealt a hard blow, but we can rise up, we can build back and we can build back better. St. Nicholas is better than the church that was there before. We didn’t just rebuild St. Nicholas. This is a vastly improved physical structure from what it was. This is going to be a national landmark, St. Nicholas, when it’s done.',\n",

We don’t even understand the extent of the economic damage that has been done. And it’s going to be hard, I’m telling you that. But we’ve done it before, we’ll do it again. And that’s what St. Nicholas said to me today when I was there. In terms of the national situation, and I want to speak plain truth on this, we said we have two threats. We have the lack of compliance and we have the national situation. The national situation is getting worse, it’s not getting better. That is a fact, as I like to say. It’s an inarguable fact.

What was the old phase? If the new phase is extensive spread, what was the old phase? That was limited spread what we went through? I mean, it’s absurd. It’s not a new phase. It was entirely predictable. It was the progression of a virus, its exponential increase, which is what a virus does. One person affects two people, two people infect four… It is the exponential pyramid of viral spreads. It’s not a new phase. It was a mathematical equation that you just have to factor out.

And just because you send me a form that says it has been determined that school is safe to return to, no, it’s not enough. It’s not enough for me. I want to review the plan. I want to understand the plan. I have questions that I want to ask.” They’re asking me the questions. I mean, they’re good questions. “The school district is going to test. How many tests? How many kids do you have? How many tests? Is that a representative sample? How long is it going to take you to get the test returns? Do you know? Where are you going to find these tests? You don’t have them now. Where are they going to come from? All the information says the test results are coming back slower. You’re going to get them done faster? How?”',\n",

They’re required. They’re going to be there. By the contract, it says Quest Lab will do the 8,000 tests, the turnaround time will be two days.

Okay, so you have roughly how many parents, 2 to 3 million? You have 2 to 3 million people looking at that plan. They’re going to determine if it’s safe, they’re going to blow the whistle.

You know, you may be aggravating food insecurity, that children can’t eat. You know that you will be aggravating the disparity between wealthier households and poorer households, because remote learning is not an equalizer, it is a separator.

The top line is easy. “I can open the schools, everybody’s going to be safe, I’m going to do testing, I’m going to do cohorting, have a nice day.” But I don’t believe they’ve gotten to the point where they have declined any program.

Not only his Operation Warp Speed, accelerating the development of a vaccine, we’re also directing a colossal industrial mobilization to ensure its rapid delivery. Nothing’s happened like this since the end of World War II. Instead of the usual sequence of vaccine development, testing and trials, followed by production, our strategy is to conduct these phases simultaneously, so everything goes at one time. We’re not waiting and waiting and waiting. It’s all going at one time. We have a system that has, I think it’s unparalleled, has never been done before, but we suspect it’s going to work and work very well. We’re mass-producing all of the most promising vaccine candidates in advance so that on the day one, that it’s approved, it will be available to the American people immediately and we’ll probably have a lot for a lot of other people throughout the world.',\n",

Another dimension of Operation Warp Speed, is our focus on therapeutics to treat the virus over 100, including Remdesivir, which is having a tremendous impact. You see that with mortality rates and other things, statistically. Dexamethazone, convalescent plasma and antibody treatments, we have numerous treatments right now that are under study. I think over the next couple of weeks, we may actually have some very positive answers as to that. On July 7th, we announced a $450 million agreement with Regeneron to begin advanced manufacturing of its antibody treatment, which is currently in late stage clinical trials, late stage. Due to the medical advances we’ve already achieved and our increased knowledge in how to treat the virus, the mortality rate for patients over the age of 18 is 85% lower than it was in April.',\n",

In the middle of April, more than 22% of all deaths in the United States were attributable to the China virus. As the last week, that number has dropped down. As of last week, it’s dropped down to under 7%. To decrease the turnaround times for testing, the first two laboratories have been approved to provide pooled testing. Very important. In other words, samples from multiple patients are processed together. They are pooled. Now, pool testing will reduce turnaround times by more than substantially, more than 50%. Last week, our centers for Medicare and Medicaid services began distributing rapid point of care, diagnostic test instruments to all of the nursing homes in the United States, focusing on the areas of greatest need, which is our elderly and our nursing homes.',\n",

The United States has conducted over 52 million tests. That’s more than all of Europe put together times two. Nobody’s even close, and as countries go, it is as an example, India is up to 11 million tests. We’re going to be very shortly at 55 million tests. India has 1.4 billion people.

My administration is also closely monitoring the surging caseload in Latin America, which is now the region in the world with the most active reported infections by far. Due to the relative scarcity of testing in Latin America however, the regions reported number of cases is also likely to be dramatically undercut or under-counted.

I want to begin by just saying thank you. Once again I want to say thank you to the healthcare workers, our doctors, our nurses, our healthcare professionals, everybody that’s on the frontline, we know how hard you’re [inaudible 00:02:05] and we’re incredibly grateful for what you’re doing in protecting Arizonans and protecting their lives and also to the business leaders and to the workforce in Arizona. This has been a challenging time for everyone. We’ve been having a lot of discussions with business leaders and leaders of employer organizations so we could make the best possible decisions and to all Arizonans. This is affecting everyone in our state. We’re in this together, we’ve asked you to do a lot and we’re going to share with you the results of where Arizona is today and it wouldn’t be happening without your partnership and participation.',\n",
              "  'Governor Doug Ducey: (02:50) I want to remind everyone as I have over the last several weeks that you are safer at home. Regardless of the information I’m going to be able to share today, coronavirus is with us today and going forward. It’s highly contagious and it’s in every part of our state and you really help Arizona when you are at home at this point in the pandemic.',\n",
              "  'Governor Doug Ducey: (03:21) Today’s numbers are 152,944 total COVID-19 cases. This week we have 2,751 average cases and my heart, prayers and thoughts go out to the 3,063 Arizona families who have lost a loved one to the coronavirus. All people in Arizona have been affected by COVID-19, none more so than these families and you are in our thoughts and our actions every day. In terms of Arizona’s trend today, our major metrics are headed in the right directions. COVID-like illness in emergency room has a downward trend. COVID patient, ICU and hospital bed use has a downward trend, and the percentage of positive tests in Arizona has a downward trend. Let’s run through the numbers. Blue line is COVID-like illness in Arizona, the gold line is influenza-like. If you look at the COVID-like, the blue line, you can see the two legs over the last two weeks are a dramatic drop down from 18.2% to 10.7. That’s in just two weeks that much of a decrease. Thank you to Arizonans for participating in this improvement.',\n",
              "  'Governor Doug Ducey: (05:02) Our COVID cases by day, if you can see on the chart, our cases began to ramp up in June and escalated. Through July, they’re headed in the other direction, so for several weeks, we had a trend going in the right direction. Now we’re seeing some … I’m sorry, in the beginning of June we had a trend headed in the wrong direction. Over the last couple weeks, you see the beginnings of a trend in the right direction. We need to continue that, headed in the right direction in terms of lessening our cases by day and most specifically in terms of lowering our positivity rate in Arizona. The blue mountain data graph is the number of tests in Arizona. The gold line is our percentage positivity. We’ve been as high as 21.1%. In this last week, a downward trend of 14.5%. It’s the right direction. It’s still too high, but it is headed in the right direction.',\n",
              "  'Governor Doug Ducey: (06:16) Let’s look at our hospital bed capacity. This does not include the 2,600 additional surge beds in our preparation for a potential worst case scenario, but what you see here is capacity. The gold is the COVID-like illness or the patients that do have COVID inside our hospitals. If you look at the course of the last six weeks, you’ll see an increase, a flattening, and the beginnings of a slight decrease. You’ll see the same thing here with our ICU beds. It does not include the surge capacity beds that we had, but for the patients that have COVID, you’ve seen an increase, a flattening, and the beginning of a slight decrease. You’ll see the same trend here for ventilators around COVID-19.',\n",
              "  'Governor Doug Ducey: (07:13) Our testing by day, the blue line is PCR test, the orange is serology. We are over one million total tests in the state of Arizona with many more on the way. I want to thank Dr. Crow for the saliva test that ASU has innovated and will be bringing to market, Dr. Robbins for his leadership on the serology test. We do have some issues around demand for our testing. We have tests available and we want people to take advantage of that. We’re going to be talking about that a little bit later in the presentation.',\n",
              "  'Governor Doug Ducey: (07:55) Let’s talk about the recent actions that we’ve taken in Arizona to slow the spread of this virus. We’ve basically been prohibiting large gatherings. I want to thank our mayors and county superintendents, we have nearly 90% of our state with local mask ordinances. They make a real difference. We’ve paused operations on gyms, bars, nightclubs, water parks and tubing. Superintendent Hoffman and I delayed the first day of school and we’ve reduced restaurant capacity in Arizona.',\n",
              "  'Governor Doug Ducey: (08:37) So let’s look at how that has affected our results. Nearly three plus weeks ago, I introduced this number, the R0 number into our discussions. This is the number that represents the average number of people who become infected by an infectious person. When this number was introduced on June 29, Arizona was at 1.18, meaning for every infected person, more than one person was being infected. Over the last three weeks, Arizona has moved that number 20 basis points in the right direction. Our R0 in Arizona today is beneath one, and it’s been beneath one since July 15. So I want to thank you, that couldn’t happen without the participation of the citizens of Arizona, people are listening to the safer at home instruction, they’re limiting mobility, and it is resulting in positive numbers and direction for our state.',\n",

If you can see from the 14 day trend, in many parts of our state and specifically in the most populous parts of our state, we’re seeing a decline, but we’re not seeing a decline everywhere. So I’d ask you to continue to stay vigilant. To know no matter whether you’re in Phoenix, Tucson or a rural area, the virus is contagious, and if we don’t do the things we should be doing, it can begin to more rapidly spread.',\n",
              "  'Governor Doug Ducey: (10:37) These are the newly reported cases by day in Arizona according to the Times. You can see what a tough June the state of Arizona had, how it began to flatten with some of the mitigation measures we put forward several weeks ago and now we are seeing a decline in cases and we need to continue to see that. Now Arizona’s increase in cases begins in June. Our country had a flat June. Their escalation has been in July. That’s where we’ve seen our downturn.',\n",
              "  'Governor Doug Ducey: (11:15) I said last week that for weeks and weeks, Arizona was on this page every time I looked. This is where new cases are increasing in our nation. Today there’s 42 states and territories where new cases are increasing. Last week, for the first time, we moved to where new cases are mostly the same, and this week, for the first week, we’re one of two states in the country whee new cases are decreasing. That’s where we prefer to stay and that’s where some of the actions that people are taking in the mitigation can keep us. I hear the folks that don’t want to hear from the New York Times and don’t want to hear what they have to say, so if the New York Times isn’t good enough for you, take it from MSNBC. They also show a decrease for cases in the state of Arizona, and for folks who don’t want to hear from mainstream media outlets, take it from the gold standard of excellence in public health internationally, Johns Hopkins University of Medicine. To my eye, Arizona is the greenest state in the nation. That is a downward trend over the previous three days and we’ve been there now for the last two times that we visited. That’s where we would like to stay is with a downward trend.',\n",
              "  'Governor Doug Ducey: (12:53) This is the COVID tracking project. I think they do a very good job of simplifying things. They also let you go to a graph and whether you want to see it by state, region, nation or country, you can customize it. This is Arizona’s daily case count in red and our hospitalizations in blue. You can see very simply that we’ve hit a peak and we’ve begun to head in the right direction. Let’s continue that so that we don’t have another peak.',\n",
              "  'Governor Doug Ducey: (13:33) It’s not unusual after we finish the presentation and turn it over for questions of someone to ask every now and again how do we trust the numbers that Arizona is presenting. First I want you to know that the COVID tracking project gives Arizona an A+ for our data information and that’s the Arizona Department of Health Services, that’s AZHealth.gov, so I know Arizonans can deal with the truth. We just want to make sure that you have the facts at the end of this press conference.',\n",
              "  'Governor Doug Ducey: (14:11) Now let’s talk about Arizona’s new normal and what we see for the foreseeable future. We have been in the unhappy but necessary business of breaking up large adult gatherings. That’s why you’ve seen the businesses and venues here not operating or not operating in any of the traditional senses with people and fans and congregations, and that’s where we’re going to be for some time. So today we’re going to continue to press on with the strategies that are working in Arizona and continue them. So today’s announcements around mitigation are that the closure will be extended for gyms, bars, nightclubs, water parks, and tubing.',\n",
              "  'Governor Doug Ducey: (15:11) Now people ask how do we come up with these venues for closure, and I want you to know this is the direct recommendation from the Centers for Disease Control. So when you say your decisions are going to be guided by public health and not politics or what’s popular, you listen to public health and the recommendation for these venues is closure. That’s where we are at this time. So there’s no victory lap today. There’s no celebration. We cannot let up. We need to continue to be vigilant every day in the state of Arizona, to continue pressing and to make sure that we stay focused on the fundamentals. So no victory lap, no celebration, only continued physical distancing. Washing your hands and remembering that you’re safer at home.',\n",
              "  'Governor Doug Ducey: (16:19) In addition to that, one of the things that you can do that will make the biggest difference of course is wearing a mask and I want to thank Arizonans from all over the state, I’ve been sent pictures. I know the pictures that oftentimes make the media are the ones that are outliers but I know people all over our state and especially in large crowds and when they haven’t been able to socially distance are more often than not choosing to wear a mask and I want to thank you for doing that. We want to make sure that everybody that needs a mask has access to a mask. We want to make sure that masks are there for vulnerable Arizonans. We introduced this last week at the press conference and we’re proud to partner with Hanes to provide free cloth masks to Arizona’s most vulnerable residents and to prevent the spread of COVID-19. We’ve had over 44,000 mask orders that have been received and they’re shipping now. Thank you for the order and thank you for wearing your mask.',\n",

I want to thank the leaders in the advertising industry, [inaudible 00:17:46], High Noon, Off Madison, Urias, LT, R&R and HMA Public Relations. We brought them together, we challenged them to help us make wearing masks more ubiquitous and prevalent, pull the politics out of it, and make it part of what we need to do to get the pandemic behind us and we think that they’ve done some good work and there’s going to be an ad campaign. We’re going to be advocating and resourcing this campaign statewide. We’re grateful for their work and the campaign’s going to be called Tougher Than COVID. We’re going to take a look at the couple of the spots now so hopefully this will play through the viewership in the conference.',\n",

There’s another billboard as well. “Go ahead, tell me my mask looks weak.” I think there’s … There’s more to follow.',\n",

I want to thank Superintendent of Public Instruction Kathy Hoffman for being a partner and a leader and for prioritizing Arizona children and safe and successful education in our state. I also want to thank Representative Michelle Udall and Senator Sylvia Allen for their effort and input into the plan that we’re going to present going forward, and with that, I want to turn it over to Superintendent Kathy Hoffman.

Each of those pieces are extremely complex and have taken time and partnership to work through.',\n",

I want to thank the members of our congressional delegation who have reached out to offer their advocacy for critical additional funding for schools and any upcoming relief packages. I also want to thank the Arizonans who have taken this pandemic seriously, who have made sacrifices, worn masks to protect themselves and their neighbors, physically distanced, and stayed home whenever possible. COVID-19 has impacted all of us. It has impacted my family, my staff, and my friends, my brother living in Italy was one of the first there to contract COVID-19 in February when there were still many unknowns. And thankfully he made a full recovery. My husband, a physician in residency at Phoenix Children’s Hospital, faces risks in his job every day.',\n",

It is a space to build the skills, minds, and hearts of the next generation. This is why I take so seriously, the opportunity for schools to safely reopen their facilities. It is the reason why I call on Arizonans to mask up, physically distance, and stay home whenever they are able. But I want to be clear that teaching and learning will happen no matter what the next school year looks like in your community. I am thrilled to join governor Ducey here today to share our guarantees on how we will support schools in providing safe instruction and critical services during this next academic year. Thank you.',\n",

Arizona will be open for learning and our priorities are going to be public health and safety. We’re going to make data driven decisions. There will be parental choice, options for families in different situations, flexibility to our school leaders. And recognizing that the achievement gap and the digital divide are real and do everything we can to reduce and eliminate it. And viewing our schools as our most essential service we provide as we move forward.',\n",
              "  'Governor Doug Ducey: (26:26) Now I also want to thank all the leaders, influencers, and decision makers, superintendents, and the superintendent. This plan was informed by your input. Well, much of the public discussion has been focused on a date certain. The focus needs to be on ensuring that Arizona students have a successful academic year. The goal is to provide our students with rigorous instruction and consistency in learning while prioritizing their health and safety. This is the greatest challenge to public education in our lifetimes. And Arizona has the opportunity to lead the nation and that superintendent Hoffman and my goal to make Arizona a model state in this situation, providing the best learning experience to kids in the safest environment during this crisis.',\n",
              "  'Governor Doug Ducey: (27:27) So 180 days of instruction or equivalent hours will be required this year. There will be options for in-person and distance learning, and there will be teacher led distance learning that must begin by the first date of the academic school year. Children deserve a safe learning environment. This includes kids and especially kids enrolled in free and reduced lunch programs, special education students, English language learners, and foster kids. So our schools must provide free onsite learning and support services while implementing healthy and safe protocols in the required onsite learning. Our decisions will be data-driven with maximum flexibility to local school leaders, recognizing they need public health data to make decisions.',\n",

Local school leaders will make the determination and consider these recommendations. Face coverings, schools will develop an implement face covering policies. All adults will have a face covering on inside a school. There will be exceptions for students when they can socially distance outside in playground settings, breaks for students to take their masks off in a safe environment and other exceptions outlined by the Centers for Disease Control.',\n",

This will ensure budget stability, recognize additional costs in-person learning we’ll bring to districts in the school year and closing the achievement gap. This has been pointed out by many leaders in K-12 education, how real this was, how it was amplified last year. I want to thank Dr. Chad Gaston of Phoenix Unified for pointing this out in our last visit. $40 million to expand broadband, 20 million to bring in support for high need schools, six million for the teacher’s academy, a million dollars in micro grants to support innovative programs. A million dollars for the school of the deaf and blind. $700,000 for leadership development, 500,000 for tutoring kids from Teach for America. So if you have questions or you want to see more on this, you can go to your school’s website for specifics to your superintendents. This also be up on the superintendent’s website, along with the governor’s website with more to follow',\n",
              "  'Governor Doug Ducey: (30:57) Learning starts now. And when you want to see the specifics around now, that’s where you go to your local website. Switching gears again, around getting tested, talking about the coronavirus. We know people want to get tested, we have prioritized essential workers, symptomatic and sick folks. Today we have tests available. This is CDC surge testing. These sites have been up and running since Friday, to date the wait times have been minimal, and unfortunately the demand has been low. If you look in Maryvale, our task capacity had 28% of the test that’s been administered and in South Phoenix it’s been less. So we want more to get tested at the sites. It’s completely free. There’s no ID required. Centrally located in the Valley and you’ll have the results between 48 and 72 hours. If you need more specific information, go to azhealth.gov/surgetesting. And with that, I want to turn it over to Dr. Cara Christ for a public health update. Dr. Christ.',\n",
              "  'Dr. Cara Christ: (33:19) So to talk about expanding testing a little bit more ASU will be expanding their saliva based testing sites. These are the free sites that they collect at. They will continue to operate out of the West Valley. We will be adding sites in Pima County, Coconino County, and La Paz County. And then we have been working with additional providers to expand testing or to expand their capacity. And that includes Embry Women’s Health, CVS pharmacies. The federally qualified health centers will be receiving grants to provide testing at their centers. We’re working with a quality health to expand their testing in partnership with CLPC as well as banner has expanded the number of tests that they can perform. And they do have sites that are available.',\n",
              "  'Dr. Cara Christ: (35:11) That’s the time from the collect, to the time that they report get that result. Obviously since 7.5 is an average. We do know that there are days that are longer. We’re getting a lot of questions about the viability of the samples and how long that they can be stored. So they can be refrigerated for several days, between three and five days, depending on what type of media they are in and how they are collected. They can be frozen at your regular freezer temperature. So minus 20 degrees for a week, if you put them at minus 70 or minus 80, which we refer to as a deep freeze, they can be frozen indefinitely and rewarmed, and then tested. The long turnaround times like I said, do impact public health because we want to be able to connect with the people. We want to give them the instructions on how to prevent transmitting COVID-19 to others. And we want to get in touch with their contacts so that we can break that transmission chain.',\n",
              "  'Dr. Cara Christ: (36:55) So to talk about a couple of the initiatives that we announced the last week on our hospital resources, we have implemented the staffing initiative. We were able to secure that contract with Vizient. We have placed a request for 584 staff to be allocated to hospitals in every region of the state. We are prioritizing rural hospitals that have high transfer to our metropolitan high acuity hospitals. And then we’re prioritizing our large hospitals that receive a number of those transfers. Staffing at some of those sites starts this week.',\n",

And thanks for all the good work that all the people at DEMA are doing and the brave women and men of the national guard as well. They have been helpful at every turn and all of Arizona is grateful. So our plan of action moving forward is that we’re going to continue to take a responsible approach. The decisions from my office will be guided by public health. We’re going to ramp up the testing to identify infection in Arizona. You can see the investment around increasing lab capacity and the additional collection sites. We want to provide relief to health officials and contact tracing to contain the spread and we’ll measure the efficacy of our mitigation strategies.',\n",
              "  'Governor Doug Ducey: (40:26) Metrics to watch, we’ve had a downward trending cases, but we are going to continue to focus on additional testing. So with that, there may be more cases on a horizon. Please let’s focus on the percent positivity. That’s a number that we want to drive down. We’re in a position today where we have capacity where people that are curious can get a test, and we want to encourage you to get a test and schedule a test. You can go to azhealth.gov for more information.',\n",
              "  'Governor Doug Ducey: (40:58) Also that mobility and R-naught number is something we want to keep below one. If you make good decisions and are responsible, stay safer at home, that’s helpful there. And of course we want to make certain as we have the entire time. And this is why, again, I want to say thank you to our doctors and nurses and health care professional and hospital leaders. We have had capacity in Arizona. We’ve been able to bring capacity to Arizona and our commitment is we will maintain capacity in the state of Arizona. So the next steps are wear a mask, wash your hands, physically distance. And when you can stay home, please wear the mask. The virus is widespread. And remember you’re safer at home. And with that, we’ll open it up for questions, Patrick.',\n",

I don’t know, we’re away from a date specific target at this point. Does that number still stand with you? Would that still be helpful to encourage districts or to show districts that it might be safe to resume in classroom learning?',\n",

And some of the reports we’ve seen have indicated that they might extend those benefits partially. So cut $600 to 300 or 200. Are you considering anything at a state level like raising the benefit cap from $ 240 a week or increasing the earned income disallowance to alleviate that burden on Arizona’s if that becomes the case?',\n",

But where Arizona has been able to navigate through this in terms of putting our safety net out, making sure no one has fallen through the cracks, through a lot of displacement was a partnership with our federal government in doing that.

I think we’ve been able to see that. When we first had our meeting with the Superintendents after the end of last school year all of the preparations were about going back into school in the traditional setting. Through the course of the discussions we’ve really found that we’ve got a very large constituency that no matter what in this setting, and I mean no matter what even back in the beginning they don’t feel comfortable or feel safe and likely do not want to go back into schools until there’s a vaccine.',\n",

And then we also have a very large constituency that has nowhere else to go except to the school. Their parent may be one of our frontline healthcare workers inside the hospital, and they have to go to work. So we’re trying to enhance the guidance, to answer all the questions just like some of the questions that we face today around what if and what happens and what if this scenario happens in a school, what if a student, what if a teacher, what if a classroom, what a cohort. You can really go down one after another. We’re letting the subject matter experts from public instruction and the Department of Health Services along with the Centers for Disease Control do that. What we laid out for you today was that we’re going to have a safe and successful school year in the state of Arizona with flexibility, ample resources, and there will be hybrid options available.',\n",

And I want to really hand it not only to our leaders and our Superintendents and our teachers, but I think as much as I wish we didn’t have to deal with what happened in the spring I think our state had a leap frog forward in terms of innovations and teachers that have embraced distance learning. And Chad Guston in our last meeting said Phoenix Union and where it is right now has set an objective at least for the first quarter or first semester that they’re going to be the best in the world at distance learning. I think having a kid in a classroom is a great thing. In this situation somebody that’s got an underlying health condition or a weakened immunity we would never force them to do something that would be against their safety, and we would want to provide options for them. Do you have anything to add, Superintendent?',\n",

We want them to start connecting with our kids across the state.

So that will be where schools are developing plans for their at risk student populations or for serving essential workers children. And so there will be continued services starting at that time, but in terms of, we’re not setting a statewide date for when school will start, we’re recreating the framework so that our schools can make data informed decisions.',\n",

The date was something that the superintendent and I were using to make announcements about what was happening. But school in Arizona has never started on a certain date. We’ve had all kinds of flexibility and option from schools that go through the summer that take fall break. And this differs really by governing board and by region in the state. So the idea around the date is we wanted to pull that off the table and give the guidelines where the things that people love about Arizona education, the flexibility, the parental choice, and the additional resources while allowing the people that know how to get it done and get it done best at the local level to have those flexibilities.',\n",

And they’re doing everything they can to connect with kids and families, whether that’s calling them or online conference, the video conferencing and doing everything they can to connect with their families. But it’s never going to be the same as having all kids coming into a classroom and having all the opportunities that our schools provide. And we know there’s differences in family resources. So some of our families don’t have internet. Don’t have computer skills. Don’t maybe have parents that don’t speak English. There’s just completely different types of home situations that I am very concerned about.',\n",

I’m putting a plan as the superintendent said, that is durable regardless of what is in front of us, so that we can maximize our children’s education, make it as successful and safe as possible. I am confident that our kids did not get that experience last year. I think our teachers did everything they possibly could getting thrown the curve ball that came their way. But our kids have some makeup to do through no fault of their own, likely around math and reading and other things. And the other question was, am I concerned about a spike in the future?

              "  'Governor Doug Ducey: (01:17:20) Well, I’d be speculating, but I think it could be a number of things. One, testing has been a huge challenge in Arizona. The testing in terms of supply chain and national resources was really going to many other places because the other places were the hot spots for so long. Arizona was really not in harm’s way, writ large, the way the Eastern seaboard was for March and April and May and June. As we began to have our increase in cases and increase in testing, a lot of our wait times went longer, and we’ve worked very hard to make it more convenient for people to get a test.',\n",
              "  'Governor Doug Ducey: (01:18:07) And then in addition, sometimes the return has been too long. So we think that we’ve addressed each of those in their turn. They remain a challenge. And I think oftentimes when cases are spiking and it may be more topical in the news, there’s more demand from people that don’t feel sick or symptomatic. And we’ve had a couple of weeks of improving numbers and it’s taken away some of that demand. And we want to find a way that we can get more people tested, people that are feeling sick or symptomatic or in a vulnerable situation or a frontline worker. We’re going to prioritize tests for them. But we want the curious now to also be tested. It’s one way that we think we’ll be able to further open our economy, make better decisions about things that you get involved in. And we’re also quite certain that it will lower our positivity score as well. Dr. Christ.',\n",

We’re confident yesterday’s test, the previous week’s test, what we’ve seen in terms of the trend, that we’re making responsible, incremental decisions. And we have shut some things down that have been the CDCs recommendation. Of course we don’t want to do that. We felt that that was necessary in which to do that. And then the fact that we can expand testing logically, you should see a decrease in terms of positivity and much of what we’re talking about is still several weeks out. So oftentimes we have folks come in and say, “Why aren’t you letting us know further in advance?” I mean, this has been a dynamic and fluid situation. It’s changed. It’ll continue to change.

And so that may be one of the difference between the seven day moving average, as well as like what you see on our website. So we are monitoring that, that is a very important factor. And one of the reasons that we made the recommendation not to reopen the bars and not to reopen some of those businesses that had closed down, that was also the recommendation for why we wanted to have the benchmarks so that schools could feel comfortable. We’re not recommending that they open next week. We know that we will have the data that should be on the backlog, should be cleared by the 31st. So we should have all available data.

The county had experienced a significant rise in number of transmissions related to COVID-19. Concern was made more paramount as it relates to the overwhelming situation for the hospital system, not only in the ICUs, but the ability to provide for emergency care more broadly, diversion rates for ambulances, health care personnel questions, a lot of stress that was placed because of this pandemic on the county. On June 1st, we committed to a new process, a new protocol to help support the county in their efforts. Began the process of decompressing their hospital system. Over 650 patients were moved out of Imperial County hospitals into surrounding and neighboring communities. And, in some instances, we even brought patients here into Northern California.',\n",

The model now, as we’re referring to it, the Imperial Model was all about providing supports, building capacity at the local level, filling in gaps, meeting needs both on personal protective gear, not just personnel, meeting the needs of the hospital system, providing additional supports, new strategies, and prevention from PSA campaigns, culturally competent messages that were delivered to individuals as well as businesses and, more broadly, the community at large.',\n",
              "  'Governor Gavin Newsom: (10:07) In addition to sectoral closures that we made abundantly clear, as it relates to moving forward to address the concerns that were flaring up in certain sectors of the economy in the Valley. You can see on this slide the number of cases as they began to spike. We began to intervene. You can see the medical personnel that we began to send in around June 3rd, where we worked with, not only state, and county, and local officials, but broadened that support by getting a lot of federal supports as well from a number of federal agencies.',\n",
              "  'Governor Gavin Newsom: (10:47) You can see, after those interventions were put into place, again, beginning with the decompressing of the hospital system as a foundational principle, more targeted supports, and some additional sectoral changes as it relates to returning to a stay at home order, you could see that line spiked and substantially began its decline. 30.3%, yesterday’s positivity rate. Still high, but at 11.2%. A successful approach, one that requires constant vigilance, one that we’re continuing to engage in, but one that long windedly is now become a model in terms of our approach, the Imperial approach in other parts of the state.',\n",
              "  'Governor Gavin Newsom: (11:36) Last week, where we last joined each other, I began the process of announcing strategies in the Central Valley, in eight counties in the Central Valley, for the obvious reason that you could see exampled here on this chart. We’re starting to see, not only an increase in the positivity rates. I mentioned last week where I made some announcements about our interventions in Central Valley, that we saw positivity rates on the lower end in Fresno, at the time at 10.7%, and peaking around Tulare at a 17.7% rate. Not where we were in Imperial, but we don’t want to see it go to where Imperial went. And that’s why we felt it was appropriate to intervene using the information, using the experience, the best practice, the data collection, the approach in Imperial and beginning that approach in the Central Valley.',\n",
              "  'Governor Gavin Newsom: (12:32) Why the Central Valley? Well, again, this slide underscores the concerns. You’re starting to see the hospitalization and ICU rates increase, not just positivity rates in the Valley, outpacing the rest of California. And, if you asked me today what our biggest area of concern in a state as large as ours, it is indeed the Central Valley. We’re seeing stabilization in other parts of the state. You’ll see some declines in a moment, when I make presentation, including some stabilization and some modest declines in Southern California. The Central Valley, again, reinforced by this slide, reinforced by our presentation in Stockton last week, in our announcement last week is indeed the area of our most important targeted interventions.',\n",
              "  'Governor Gavin Newsom: (13:24) We are, again, doing everything we can to fill in local gaps and working with counties to assess their current dashboard, as it relates to data collection, identifying whatever gaps may exist or persist in their respective communities. But more importantly than anything else, identifying partners, not just partners from governmental agencies, again, federal agencies, five out of the eight Department of Defense medical teams are deployed now in the Central Valley, again federal partnerships, but also developing private partnerships. Critical to develop partnerships with employers. Critical to develop partnerships with nongovernmental organizations, nonprofits, NGOs, to again, build capacity and build our collective response with a unified command approach to addressing the concerns in the Valley.',\n",
              "  'Governor Gavin Newsom: (14:19) And so, that’s exactly what we highlighted last week. We built that partnership to include 52 million dollars of new resources for disease investigation, for contact tracing, and for our isolation and quarantine efforts. In addition to that, we have been able to… and I want to thank the Sierra Health Foundation in particular. They have been able to organize a collective effort, 6.5 million of additional dollars, resources that philanthropy has brought to the table, to supplement, or increase rather, the 52 million dollar contribution that we announced last week. And this is for rent, supplies, really helping individuals with utility bills, and the like. And focusing-',\n",
              "  'Governor Gavin Newsom: (15:03) … individuals utility bills and the like, and focusing on the most vulnerable and the most vulnerable families. And remember, this is, and Dr. Galley has made this abundantly clear in a number of his presentations, we’ve made it abundantly clear over the course of the last number of months as well. Disproportionately, this disease is impacting our diverse communities. Disproportionately impacting the Latino community, disproportionately impacting the community in the Central Valley. And so when we talk about the Central Valley, I hope we can really paint a picture in terms of our consciousness of how impactful this has been on the Latinx community. And that’s why our targeted interventions disproportionately are focusing on essential workforce, on farm workers, on critical workforce and hospitality, retail sector, and the like that is being impacted by this disease.',\n",
              "  'Governor Gavin Newsom: (15:57) And so I wanted to begin today as we left off last week, reinforcing the merits of the approach we took in Imperial County, recognizing again, good enough never is, recognizing as I do, as we do, that the effort is ongoing. There’s a constancy to our focus. There’s not just a passing interest in these efforts. They’re not episodic. There’s a full blown commitment to follow through, to bend this curve, to suppress the growth and ultimately extinguish this virus, which is indeed our long term goal, or at least mitigate its impacts through therapeutics and vaccination. As it relates to the efforts statewide to do the same, I want to give you some good news. And that is, our number of positive cases yesterday was 5,739. That is a one day number. And again, I’ve made this point abundant over the past and that is, I don’t look to one day numbers.',\n",
              "  'Governor Gavin Newsom: (17:01) They go up, they go down, there’s some weekend reporting often that is example, on Mondays. That’s why the seven day average becomes even more important. And that seven day average you’ll see, it’s 7,764. That seven day average by the way is down roughly 21.2% from the previous seven day average. That’s good news. 21.2% decline. The last time you saw a slide like this, the numbers was North of 9,800 daily average cases, 9,859 to be exact. So from 9,859 cases, seven day average from a week ago, now down 7,764, 21.2% decline from our previous reporting period. Again, that’s case numbers. And I caution folks, look, I’ve said this in the past, others have said this, some for different purposes than the purpose which we reinforce this. As we increase our tests, you’re going to see an increase in case numbers. I caution people not to focus as much on that, but to look at positivity rates and look at hospital rates and ICU rates in the state of California.',\n",
              "  'Governor Gavin Newsom: (18:21) They’ve become more profoundly significant from the perspective of mortality, from the perspective of our healthcare, delivery system and our capacity. We want to test as many people as we can, but the purpose of the test is not just to show a number, it’s an effort to have a sense of where the community is spread is, how we can mitigate that spread, how we can help support our contact tracers, isolate, quarantine people, and ultimately mitigate the impact to our hospital system and into our ICUs. And so that’s why the positivity rate, this number, you’ve watched these presentations, you’re very familiar with this slide. This positivity rate is so important. Here is extending on the narrative of some early good signs, 21.2% decline in the seven day average total number of positive cases. But the positivity rate is also seeing a decline as we’ve increased our daily average tests.',\n",
              "  'Governor Gavin Newsom: (19:21) And you can see the number 126,000, almost 127,000 daily average test. About 140, just shy of 149,000 tests yesterday. A little bit more than that the day prior. We actually reached 177,000 tests a few days ago. But our average daily tests continue to go up. The good news is the total number of people testing positive is now going down. We have gone down to 7%. This reflected in this slide over a 14 day period shows that 7.5% number that we presented to you on multiple occasions, now again, tracking down to 7%. This is the 14 day number. I often provide you the seven day positivity rate. The last time I was with you, we made a presentation formally with you where I shared slides, which was on the 24th of July, not the presentation in Stockton last week. The seven day positivity rate was 7.8%. Got to about 8% at its peak. The seven day positivity rate is lower now than the 14 days. It’s down to 6.1%.',\n",
              "  'Governor Gavin Newsom: (20:39) So 14 day positivity rate reflected in the slide, 7%. The seven day positivity rate now down to 6.1%. It’s not where it needs to be and is still too high. But again, it is good to see this number trending down, not trending up. Not surprisingly, as we see positivity rate begin to trend down, increased number of people being tested, percentage of people being tested relative to the numbers. Being tested, lower. We are now not surprisingly seeing hospitalizations go down modestly. 10% decrease in the total number of positive cases in our hospitals over a 14 day period, 10% decrease. The last time I shared slides with you, we had seen a 9% increase. Remember, it was much as 50% a few weeks back over a 14 day period. So 50%, 50% growth. Now we’re seeing 10% decline. Last slide set, we shared with you over a week ago, showed a 9% increase. So again, a decline in total hospitalizations, not surprisingly. You’ll see the healthcare system capacity with total number of patients declining. It’s just shy of 9% of our total capacity.',\n",
              "  'Governor Gavin Newsom: (22:07) It’s holding relatively steady, not increasing as you’ve seen in some previous slides. Hospitalizations go down, we encourage to see ICU admissions also trending down. Last slide deck, we provided 11% increase in ICU admissions. You’ll see reflected in this slide, 5% decrease in ICU admissions. So again, these are statewide numbers. It does not reflect the reality in the Central Valley, doesn’t necessarily reflect the reality where you are living in a particular county, a particular part of the state, but the overall trend, both again, positivity rates, hospitalizations, now ICU is showing a decrease from where we were over a week ago. Encouraging signs, but one week does not make a kind of trend that gives us confidence to generate headlines. We are looking forward to that and we’ll need to see another few weeks of this kind of data to come in, to feel more confident about where we are as a state.',\n",
              "  'Governor Gavin Newsom: (23:14) The good news is we do feel confident in our critical care capacity. The ICU numbers declining. The total number of ICU patients reflected here in this graph to our capacity dropped modestly from 23% to 9% hospitalizations, about 9%. But did not decline, still within a percentage point here, we were able to see modest decline over the last reporting period when we presented the slide deck. 38 counties are now on our monitoring list. You’ll recall 37 counties when we announced that Santa Clara County was added to our list when we were in Stockton last week. Now 38 counties, this includes San Mateo County on low list. 58 counties in the state of California though, again, these 38 counties represent the vast majority of the population in the state. And this county monitoring, this is profoundly important to all of you that live in those counties as it relates to the sectorial guidelines we put out more restrictive in these counties than in other counties, and certainly more restrictive as it relates to reopening our schools.',\n",
              "  'Governor Gavin Newsom: (24:34) Goal ultimately is to get off this list for two weeks. And that gives us some confidence based on CDC guidelines, our own experience here in the state of California to consider making modifications. And certainly along the guidelines that we put out, as it relates to our public education system and private school system as well. That 14 day period is foundational in terms of any subsequent modifications to distance learning, which is foundationally required in these 38 counties. I’ll conclude as always to encourage people. If you are living with an individual who’s tested positive for COVID-19, it’s incredibly important because of mixed families, multigenerational families. We’re seeing a lot of spread now in people’s backyards, their front yards as well is in their living rooms. And that’s why we thought important to reinforce, remind people of the importance.',\n",
              "  'Governor Gavin Newsom: (25:38) If you are living with someone who’s tested positive or has come into contact with someone who’s tested positive, please stay at home. Don’t share items, do the kind of disinfecting that is foundational in terms of mitigating the spread of this disease. We’ll continue to highlight this area of focus as it continues to be one of the more challenging in vaccine areas in terms of mitigating the spread of the coronavirus. Accordingly, we remind you as always, the most important non-pharmaceutical intervention you can make is wearing these masks, again, doing everything in your power to physically distance yourself from people that are not part of that cohort and your household. Continue to wash your hands more broadly and minimize mixing. I just want to reinforce this. It needs to be reinforced even more. Minimize mixing to the extent possible.',\n",
              "  'Governor Gavin Newsom: (26:36) Again, that mixing could occur in your brain backyard, your front yard, but also again, in your living room, when you bring people outside, your immediate household, overextended family members, or just generationally, you are connecting with loved ones and mixing in a way that can increase the likelihood of the spread of the virus. And so that’s the update for the day. I want to just make one final point reference, and it’s an important, and that is total number of deaths in this state has increased over the course of the last few weeks. This, again, for us is a point of obvious concern. And for the family members, each and every life lost is devastating and our heart goes out. Including a young person in Fresno that lost their lives, a teenager. And this is a sober reminder of how deadly this disease is and how it can impact anybody. And while it’s absolutely true, and I don’t want to be an alarmist, it’s absolutely true that number of people that contact this disease that are in their late teens, even early teens, the likelihood of deaths is very, very low.',\n",
              "  'Governor Gavin Newsom: (27:54) The reality is we tragically lost a teenager to this virus. And it’s just sober reminder of how powerful and impactful and deadly this disease remains to be and how important it is to do the kind of work we all must do as a society, as a community and as individuals to do what we can to mitigate that spread, to wear those masks, to physically distance, to avoid the kind of mixing large crowds and outside your immediate household as much as you possibly can. 32 additional lives were lost in our last reporting period yesterday. But I want to just caution you, 32 is a lower number than you’ve seen in the past. The average numbers now well North of 100, and with the increase we’ve experienced over the last few weeks, the lagging number, lagging indicator always in term of the deaths, this number is reflected as a lagging indicator, meaning we’re likely to see those numbers remain stubbornly high over the course of the next number of days, potentially next week or so.',\n",
              "  'Governor Gavin Newsom: (29:06) We’re going to monitor that closely. We’ll talk openly and honestly as much as we can about it. I don’t want you to be misled into feeling some more confidence about that 32 numbers. Again, look at those seven and 14 day averages, not just one day over another day. 121 lives on average we’ve lost a day as an example, just over the 14 day period as it relates to the deaths associated with COVID-19. So that’s an update on where we are. I again want to remind everybody of the importance of targeting our focus and continuing to build capacity and build partnerships. We continue to do that county by county, health director by health director, and business by business. And I will be remiss. I’ll just close on this. I want to thank the business community. We’ve been out, alcohol beverage control-',\n",
              "  'Governor Gavin Newsom: (30:03) -community. We’ve been out, alcohol beverage control and been out in bars and restaurants and thousands of in-person visits. OSHA has been out in tens of thousands of visits. I just want to mark this as a point of consideration and thought. The vast majority of businesses are doing everything in their power, doing their best under these very difficult circumstances, and the vast majority that are not 100% in compliance come into compliance very, very quickly. I want to just acknowledge that and recognize that perfect rarely is on the menu. People are doing their best under extraordinary circumstances both as individuals, as customers, as employers, their employees. It’s exampled in all the outreach that’s been done and the incredible compliance that we’ve seen. We haven’t seen it everywhere, and we are putting out citations. Obviously, this is being advanced at the local level as well, substantially from an enforcement frame, including enforcing on mask mandates as well, local government taking the lead in that space and amplifying some of the efforts that are happening at the state level.',\n",
              "  'Governor Gavin Newsom: (31:20) But I do want to acknowledge how the business sector is doing, and under incredible circumstances, how grateful we are to all of you that are represented in that respect and to all of the employees and customers that are doing their best as well under very trying and difficult circumstances. With that, of course, we’re happy to answer any questions.',\n",

As schools get ready to reopen, distance learning at the vast majority of them, there are some districts that are requiring teachers to actually go into their classroom and teach their distance learning from those schools. That has some teachers upset. They cite safety concerns, also childcare issues. What is your take on that? Do you think teachers should be required to go to schools to teach?',\n",
              "  'Governor Gavin Newsom: (32:13) No, I think that has to be done. First of all, we give a lot of discretion to local what we call LEAs. These are local education agencies, authorities, local capacity to make those decisions, but based upon bargaining, based upon working with labor and making those decisions in a collaborative frame. I don’t believe anyone should be forced to put their life and health at risk, period, full stop. If people feel their lives are being put at risk and their health is being put at risk, it is incumbent upon us to call that out.',\n",
              "  'Governor Gavin Newsom: (32:53) We have been working very closely with organized labor. We are very grateful for their support and guidance of a lot of the information that we put out and the formal guidelines that we’ve put out and the announcement we made a few weeks ago, as it relates to the upcoming school year. It’s been done in the spirit of collaboration and cooperation, and I expect and really demand respectfully that that spirit of collaboration and cooperation manifests at the local level and people not be put into harm’s way as caregivers, as teachers, as support staff from janitors to bus drivers, as secretaries to maintenance workers, as well, obviously, as our children.',\n",

We deeply recognize people’s anxiety. We deeply recognize what’s at stake. As a consequence, the spirit of collaboration, I assure you, is alive and well with not only the authors that you referenced, but their respective leadership that demonstrably is committed and focused to this.',\n",

So could you update us on what is happening with that process of contact tracing?',\n",
              "  'Governor Gavin Newsom: (37:34) No, I appreciate the questions. Dr. Ghaly will be up here in just a moment. Let me just say a number of things, and we’ve made number of presentations over the course of the last number of months as it relates to our partnership with UCSF, our partnership with UCLA to train a cohort of contact tracers. We announced a few weeks back that we have trained over 10,000, meeting our Phase 1 goals of contact tracers.',\n",
              "  'Governor Gavin Newsom: (38:01) We made additional modifications to our approach and the protocols relating to contact tracing based upon the increase in the total number of positive cases statewide that required a modification of some of our original strategies related to contact tracing, including, by the way, making available contact tracers. This is fundamental in terms of keeping our children and teachers safe in the upcoming school years when we do reopen for in-person learning, which is foundational and is ultimately our goal and our commitment, if we can mitigate the spread and see a decline in the spread of this disease.',\n",
              "  'Governor Gavin Newsom: (38:43) But to make available to the school districts, in partnership with local health officials, these same contact tracers, we have a new database system. We’ve been very fortunate to have the opting-in of the vast majority of counties into the statewide database system. It’s a system that is also being utilized and deployed in some other states, including Massachusetts, and that provides the ability in real time to share information in this space.',\n",
              "  'Governor Gavin Newsom: (39:11) With that, let me ask Dr. Ghaly to provide you a little bit more information about the contact tracing, talk a little bit about vitamin D, and talk about when indeed someone who may have been exposed, what is that gestation period for determining if indeed they have tested positive or indeed are a carrier, even asymptomatic carrier, of COVID-19. Dr. Ghaly.',\n",
              "  'Dr. Ghaly: (40:30) So we continue to build up that workforce in anticipation that as we continue to do the things we know reduce our case counts, we build up that workforce so that we match them and we can begin to identify all new cases and support those so that they don’t become big outbreaks as we try to reduce transmission.',\n",
              "  'Dr. Ghaly: (41:29) So the first thing to say is if you are at all symptomatic with COVID-19-like symptoms, we encourage you to get tested immediately. Reach out to a provider, if you have one. Go to the covid19.ca.gov website. Go to our testing page and sign up for a test there. We think that should happen immediately. If you are a close contact, that means somebody who spent 15 or more minutes six or so feet closer to somebody who’s known COVID-positive, let’s say in an indoor gathering where you’re not, unfortunately, using a mask, we know that the masks protect quite a bit in reducing transmission. If you’re experiencing symptoms, you should go immediately and get tested. If you’re not and you’re a close contact, waiting about two days roughly after that contact I think is probably the best time to go get tested.',\n",

I think it is all of the above and growing recognition in a state where we flattened the curve, we never experienced the spikes other parts of the country experienced, in our own capacity to manifest, meaning our own individual capacity to make better decisions, to physically distance, to wash our hands, to avoid mixing, as well as the modifications. Let’s be candid, these sectoral modifications that have been very, very difficult and very trying for small businesses in particular that have just beared a huge brunt of the-',\n",

All of these things in total have made the impact, at least as it relates to what we’re experiencing recently. That said, these are just a few days, five out of six days. We’ve seen a decline in ICUs. We’ve seen some stabilization in most parts of the state, though not in every part of the state, Central Valley being the obvious area of concern and hospitalizations is encouraging. At the same time, we can quickly find ourselves back to where we were just a few weeks ago, a month ago, with significant increases if we do not maintain our vigilance, if we do not maintain our focus and our commitment.',\n",

It’s not going to take Halloween off or the holidays off until we have quality of therapeutics, until we have a vaccine, we are going to be living with this virus. And I think if there’s any lesson that we’ve learned from the California experience, while it is true the positivity rates in this state have never manifested as they have in other parts of this country, the reality is our first effort, we made tremendous progress because 40 million strong really met that moment and did everything in their power to mitigate the growth and spread of this virus.',\n",
              "  'Governor Gavin Newsom: (46:35) As we began to modify our stay at home orders, people began to mix, as people began to put down, well, some cases put down their mask, literally not just figuratively. We started to see that case rate grow. We started to see the background rates begin to grow, the community spread begin to grow. And so we had to tighten that back up. So let us not make that, well, let’s not relive that experience again, as we work again, our way through the first wave of this pandemic. We anticipate the second wave in the fall. And that second wave also challenged by what Dr. Ghaly just said, as it relates to flu season on top of COVID-19 likely having a resurgence in that second wave around the same time and the impact that can have, and the stress that can have on our system.

And you’re now seeing this modest decline that we’ve exampled here today. So to the extent, and again, I’ve been very honest about this, open about it in previous questions, and I appreciate yours. We will consider that if we feel it’s necessary, critical and important, but at the moment, based upon the progress we have made, we feel we can’t get our arms around this in a judicious way.',\n",

Looking at procurement strategies, looking at testing protocols, looking at contact tracing and the like. And so across the spectrum, we’ve been able to resource one another, pick the brains of our respective colleagues, as well as connect as we have more formally, as you recall with our Western States approach, where they have the ability now in real time, we have the ability in real time through that partnership to engage.',\n",

It’s turned out to be an extraordinarily robust partnership and turned out partnership is working in ways that perhaps people did not anticipate in the beginning.

And so it’s not just stabilizations we’re looking for, is we want to see some marked decline stabilization and a commensurate effort, which is critical of education about any modification, subsequent modifications, to our guidance and stay at home orders and sectoral strategies.',\n",

And we needed to be equally focused in educating the public about what these modifications were and were not.

Numbers don’t lie. Infection rates are now going up in more states than there are going down. More than 125,000 people in the United States have lost their lives, and those numbers and new infections continue to grow at alarming rate. And once again is confronting the simple fact that we won’t be able to solve the economic crisis without a rigorous public health approach. They’re not separable. Despite the administration’s propaganda, that their response should be a cause for celebration, despite President Trump’s requests that we should slow down testing because he thinks it makes him look bad, the COVID-19 is still here, and the daily threat to American health and prosperity is continuing.',\n",

Month after month, as other leaders in other countries took the necessary steps to get the virus under control, Donald Trump failed us. Month after month, as many of us urged him to step up and do his job, he failed us. Just look at the record. In January, I, along with others, sounded the alarm of the coronavirus outbreak. Trump told the country that COVID-19 is, quote, “totally under control,” and then everything will, quote, “work out well.” In February, I warned about the failure to get information that we needed from the Chinese government. What I said was the president should demand Xi produce the evidence. Demand it. Trump said, quote, “We’re in great shape.” Reported China’s president said it was, quote, “doing very well.”',\n",

How did he respond? He accused health workers of stealing your masks. That’s what he said. “Healthcare workers are stealing the masks. That’s why we don’t have them.”',\n",

Trump’s suggestions? Americans should inject disinfectants into their bodies. In May, I condemned the false choice between preserving public health and our economy. I urged the administration to focus on the basic public health measures, like testing, that would enable us to sustain our economic recovery. Trump’s response? He pushed for reopening without regard to safety, and called testing, quote, “frankly, overrated.”',\n",

Trump’s proposal, he set a cutoff date for federal funding of testing sites in several states, and actually went to court to take away healthcare for 22 million people by trying to get rid of Obamacare. And now Donald Trump is in retreat. Remember, back in March, when I called, and he called, we talked about the need to act like we were at war with the virus. He called himself a war time president. Remember when he exhorted the nation to sacrifice together, and quote, ” in the face of this inevitable and invisible enemy”? What happened?

We can’t continue half wearing masks and half rejecting science. We can’t continue half with a plan and half just hoping for the best. We won’t defeat this virus with a piecemeal approach, lifting restrictions prematurely, increasing the volatility of the crisis, raising the likelihood of needing to reimpose restrictions. Until our science catches up to reality, until we have better treatment for those who become infected, and ultimately are safe, proven, widely available vaccines, we have to continue to do all we can, as the people in the government, to keep our fellow Americans safe and healthy.',\n",

People aren’t waiting in lines for miles and miles long in baking hot cars for drive through nasal swabs for the fun of it.

Testing is how we see what’s happening in communities all across the country. It’s our eyes on the ground. Without that testing, we’re flying blind. That’s why it’s so important to have reliable access to testing everywhere. We need to increase federal support for testing. That includes doubling the number of drive through testing sites and keep increasing them until there are no more lines. We should create a pandemic testing board to spearhead a nationwide campaign, so every worker, every worker who’s called back to their job can have the confidence that they and their fellow workers are not infected.',\n",

There’s been some progress toward treatment and vaccines, but the administration hasn’t been transparent about how they plan to manufacture enough doses to make sure there’s equitable distribution to scale. I hope they’re doing it now. I called for a while ago, they should be providing $250 million to have a plan now, exactly how they’re going to distribute this, so every American has access when and if the vaccine’s available. They may be doing it, but we have no transparency. Let us see, Mr. President. The White House should report weekly on this progress.

It is essential to coordinating the global response during a pandemic, and the United States should be leading that response as we had in the past.

Whether it was when his horse drawn carriage paused atop the Edmund Pettus Bridge, resting on the red rose petals that contrasted with his own blood that was shed some 55 years ago, or having our state’s troopers stand and salute as the Congressman passed over the bridge for one final time, Alabamians came from all parts of the state to pay their final respects to this proud son of Alabama, native of Troy.',\n",

To my left, another guy who needs no introduction, the superintendent of the state police, Colonel Pat Callahan, director of the office of Homeland Security and Preparedness, Jared Maples is with us. Good afternoon. First. I want to wish everyone in our state’s wonderful, extraordinary Muslim community, by the way, the second largest Muslim American community of any American state, a blessed Eid al Adha, the festival of sacrifice commemorating God’s test of Abraham and marking the end of the Hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca. So, to all, Eid Mubarak.',\n",

The News was an important link that connected new Jersey’s diverse Jewish communities and which strengthened the bond between our state and the one hand and the state of Israel on the other. And I want to give a shout out to our friend ambassador, Dani Dayan. His last day as Israel’s console general in New York, including service to New Jersey, is today. And we wish him the very best and thank him for his extraordinary partnership over the past two and a half years during our time here.',\n",

When I took my first international economic mission as governor, I made sure it included a stop in Israel, a key trading and business partner. And, as always, the Jewish News was there to cover it. So, to all the reporters and editors who, over the years, have put out the paper edition, New Jersey Jewish News, every Shabbat, thank you. And I hope the news will continue in an online format. You are all a vital part of a vital force for the good, a vital voice and force for the good.',\n",

With millions of families literally left hanging, to simply go home for a long weekend is the ultimate act of irresponsible behavior and dereliction of duty. Senator McConnell, please, get back to Washington and get this done. Families across our state, and indeed, across the nation, are facing literally an economic meltdown on your watch. And this is no time to take a weekend, nevermind a long weekend off. Despicable.',\n",

Every day, we receive a summary from Ed and his team at the Communicable Disease Service, which provides a detailed overview of cases and data pertaining to hospitalizations and deaths. That data will now be put in a more interactive and easy to navigate form. The dashboard available at COVID-19.nj.gov will provide statewide and county level trends in COVID-19 confirmed cases, deaths, and hospitalizations over time.',\n",

The breakdowns by race and ethnicity are given greater clarity. And we are also posting the complete curve of confirmed cases by date of death, as well as the dates of the deaths we currently have listed as probable. Throughout this pandemic, we have occasionally made tweaks to the way we present data to provide greater context or clarity. And today’s upgrades to the dashboard continue that work. And I must thank Judy, and Ed, and their teams for their ongoing efforts.',\n",
              "  'Governor Phil Murphy: (05:44) So, if you go to the dashboard, you will see that we are today reporting an additional 699 positive test results, pushing the total number of cases of Coronavirus in New Jersey since March 4th to 181,660. Before I move on, I’d like to note that, even with the increases we have seen in the latest case numbers, New Jersey remains among the ten states nationwide with the lowest number of active cases per capita. I want to warn you in advance. You’re going to get on the one hand on the other hand today. Because the other hand we’re going to be pretty tough on it as well.',\n",

That is also not quite as good as it’s been, but that’s pretty darn good. We have continued to increase our volume of testing over the past couple of weeks. And, as a result, we remain among the five states with the lowest daily percent positivity. Again, one of the top ten cases in lowest number of active cases per capita. And we remain among, to repeat, the five states with the lowest daily percent positivity.',\n",

It’s too uneven. And, for the most part, it’s too long. And we had a good call with John.',\n",
              "  'Governor Phil Murphy: (07:18) Side by side With that, we also continue ramping up our contact tracing capabilities and working with local health departments to identify causes of outbreaks that have contributed to recent increases in our cases. And Judy and I will have more on that next week, both I would bet technologically, but also an update here in person. However, the increases in new cases we have seen over the past week has pushed the statewide rate of transmission to 1.35. And, given the recent data on cases, we anticipate, unfortunately, that it will go higher in the days ahead.',\n",
              "  'Governor Phil Murphy: (07:56) So, here’s on the other hand. Look, the numbers are setting off alarms that we are taking and we take very seriously. We still may be among the leaders in having the lower case numbers and daily positivity rates. We don’t take that for granted, but we are standing in a very dangerous place. As I said, the alarms are going off. The only way to silence these alarms and get back to the process of moving forward is for everyone to take them seriously, not just most of you, but all of you, all of us. We are not past this. Everyone who walks around refusing to wear a mask, or who hosts an indoor house party, or who over stuffs a boat is directly contributing to these increases. This has to stop and it has to stop now.',\n",

Meaning, if your capacity is, say, 100, then you can have no more than 25 people inside. It’s the lesser of 25% or 100 individuals. And I want to reiterate that I and we reserve the right to lower this threshold if necessary to protect public health. I’m not anticipating or announcing, I should say, any specific action today. But consider this as being put on notice. We will not tolerate these devil may care, nonchalant attitudes any longer. Pat is going to have a couple of specific comments on compliance. And he’s got one thing in particular that relates to indoors that he will hit hard. And I will be happy to come in behind you and hit hard as well.',\n",

As of last night, there were 352 COVID confirmed patients being treated with an additional 343, Judy, persons under investigation, pending the return of their test results. That’s a total of 695 hospitalizations. Of those, 113 required intensive care and 45 ventilators were in use. Overall, the trends in our hospitals continue to move our healthcare system in the right direction.

And today we must report another ten confirmed deaths and losses of blessed lives. Of these, Judy, you and I talked about this earlier, seven occurred in the past five days. And three of those were on July 27, the only day with more than one confirmed death of late. This is a big deal. And I know Judy is going to want to come in behind this as well.',\n",

That is the first day that we can say that that is the case since March 10th, 142 days ago, almost five months ago. And you’ve asked us, folks, will we get one of those days? And we said, we’d get it. We just didn’t know when. It was the 24 hours that ended last night. So, I think we’re all going to just take a quick moment and reflect on that again. The first day we can say that since March ten.',\n",
              "  'Governor Phil Murphy: (11:46) Well, this is an extraordinary milestone. Let me just remind folks, and Judy and Ed, correct me if you think I’m wrong about this, I’m going to say about a month ago is about when you would have been plus or minus infected. And I know there’s some that were a lot longer and some that were shorter that would have led to a death around now. If you look at the number of positives that we were reporting at the end of June, as we are in the end of July, it was averaging about 350 a day. There were a couple of days higher and there were a couple of days lower in that last week of June. This past week, the average, eye balling it, and again, a big number today, a somewhat lesser number yesterday, let’s smooth that out, is averaging about 550. So, let’s just remember deaths or lack of deaths, thank God, in this case, reflect positive cases. This is a lagging indicator of what we were seeing. And again, I’m simplifying about a month ago, about 350 a day of positive cases. This past week, 550 a day of positive cases.',\n",
              "  'Governor Phil Murphy: (12:55) So, not only do we commemorate, reflect, and celebrate zero deaths in our hospitals over the past 24 hours, we have to also acknowledge the number of positive cases is meaningfully higher right now on average than it was a month ago. The total number of lost lives that are confirmed, lab confirmed 13,944. And the number of probable deaths remains at 1,875. As we do every day, let’s recall three more of the blessed members of our New Jersey family who we have lost. We begin by remembering Dominick on the left and Shirley on the right D’Stefan of Florham Park, which they called home for 65 years. D’Stefan, their family walked me through this, Dominick’s ancestors came from Italy. Their name was in fact DiStefano. But, in the lost in translation reality of Ellis Island, the eye behind the D got flipped into an apostrophe and the O at the end of DiStefano got dropped. So, they are D’Stefan, the proudly Italian Americans. Dominick was born in the Chambersburg section of Trenton in the house, by the way, that his father, a mason, built by hand. And I think it was his dad who was the one who came over and immigrated as first generation.',\n",
              "  'Governor Phil Murphy: (14:18) At the onset of World War II, Dominick enlisted in the U.S. Navy and served as a radar technician aboard the light cruiser the U.S.S. Wooster. From that posting, he developed a lifelong interest in electronics. After the war, he earned a degree in electrical engineering under the GI Bill from Temple University. But his budding career in the field was short circuited when he was recalled to the Navy to serve during the Korean War. After his second tour of duty, Dominick earned his masters in management sciences from the Stevens Institute of Technology and began a career with Bell Labs where he would work on the Telstar project, the first successful transmission of a radio wave to a target in space and back. But more importantly-',\n",
              "  'Governor Phil Murphy: (15:03) … to a target in space and back. But more importantly, it was at Bell Labs that he met Shirley. Upon his retirement from AT&7, he began a career teaching mathematics and engineering at the County College of Morris, retiring in his 80s. Dominic had a lifelong love of music and was an accomplished trumpeter and trombonist, a member, by the way, of the Musicians Union. He played in orchestras, as well as in major parades. His favorite song, as was my late father’s favorite song, was Hoagy Carmichael’s American classic, Stardust. I’m dating myself. Just one week after Dominick passed, Shirley too lost her battle with COVID-19.',\n",
              "  'Governor Phil Murphy: (15:43) Shirley was born in Carney, attended Carny High School and Uppsala college and, as we know now, she also started working at Bell Labs. After their marriage, Shirley and Dominick, by the way, she called him Dom, they settled in Florham Park to raise their daughter, Donna. Shirley would go back to work as a school bus driver for the Florham Park Board of Education and became a beloved fixture in the life of the community and in the lives of the thousands of children she transported to and from school. She knew where each one lived, what their likes were and recalling something special about their personalities. After hanging up her bus keys, Shirley took an active interest in gardening and birdwatching, making the weekly trip to Agway on Senior Citizens Tuesday for various bird seeds and treats for her feathered friends. She loved all animals and never minded when the neighborhood deer stopped by to snack on the seeds she put out. She loved to sew and bake pies and to travel the world.',\n",
              "  'Governor Phil Murphy: (16:43) Dominick and Shirley were both longtime and active parishioners at Grace Episcopal Church in Madison for over 65 years. When they passed, he was 92 and she was 90. They leave behind, as I mentioned, their daughter, Donna, and her husband, Dennis, and I had the honor to speak with both of them. So as we send them off, I want to quote Hoagy Carmichael and say, “Though I dream in vain, in my heart it will remain my stardust melody, the memory of love’s refrain.” May God bless them both. We thank Dominick for his years of service to our nation.',\n",
              "  'Governor Phil Murphy: (17:20) Next we remember John Kupcho on the left, and look at his family on the right, my Lord, of West Caldwell. Jack, as he was known, was 83. Jack served in the US Air Force and earned a bachelor of science and ornamental horticulture from the University of Tennessee, then came to New Jersey to earn his master of science and environmental science in urban planning from Rutgers University. He would have a long career at Rutgers beginning in 1963 as the Essex County Agricultural agent at the Rutgers cooperative extension, helping commercial vegetable growers in Bergen, Essex, Morris, and Passaic counties to maximize resources to increase crop yields.',\n",

Jack accepted that award from President Ronald Reagan at the White House. For as more than half century of teaching, advising, and improving agriculture, Jack received the 2015 New Jersey Board of Agriculture’s Distinguished Service to Agriculture Award. He also held the title of Professor Emeritus at Rutgers Cook College. In 1982, Jack and his first wife, Maryanne, who, by the way, sadly passed away at the very young age of 48, they took over the pine florist in Verona, and he was often in the greenhouses giving advice to novice gardeners and veteran horticulturists alike.

He was also, don’t hold this against him, or me, a lifelong Red Sox fan, an affliction which paid off late in life with their world championship runs. Jack is survived by his wife, Helen, and she’s not well either, so please pray for her, his daughters, Terry, and I had the great honor of speaking with Terry, Mary Ellen, Kathy, who, by the way, is a council woman in West Caldwell, Coleen and their spouses, and by his 10 grandchildren.

I reiterate what we’ve been saying here all week and frankly, for the past several weeks, use your common sense. We all want to get back to things the way they were, but right now that is just not possible.

This morning, the news broke that the Census Bureau will be ending its door-to-door efforts one month earlier than originally planned, on September 30th, meaning that we need you to make sure you are counted now. We cannot overstate the importance of an accurate count of all New Jerseyans in the census. It’s about protecting $45 billion every year in aid for our schools, our health care facilities and our communities. That’s $450 billion over a decade, if you’re counting at home. It’s about making sure every family has healthy food to eat and that our roads and transit systems are funded. It’s about making sure that we have what we need to rebound from this pandemic. It’s about making sure we get back every dollar from Washington that we deserve. So far, roughly two and a half million households, or 64.7% of all New Jersey households, have already responded to the census. That’s a good number, but right now we’re only good enough to rank 21st among all states in responding. We need everyone to be counted.',\n",

Please take time to go to 2020census.gov today to make sure you and your family are counted, then reach out to your friends and neighbors and make sure they are too. We know New Jersey was under counted in 2010 and because of that, we have lost out on literally billions and billions of dollars of extra federal funds over the past decade. And the news that the Census Bureau will stop its direct outreach one month early means that unless you do your civic duty, we will be counted again in. An under-count will almost certainly mean, especially, that our communities of color will be left out. There will be hundreds of activities across the state this weekend to push residents to get counted. You could find one near you, by the way, going to census.nj.gov. Census.nj.gov. Communities across the state have challenged each other to see who can outperform the other. Let’s all be a part of the census, let’s show how strong New Jersey is by getting counted today.

Cranford won the North, Jackson won the South, it should be a barn burner. Hats off to each and every member of those teams and their managers and coaches, but also to every single team who participated this. As hard as COVID-19 is to deal with, only two teams out of 222 could not play out their entire string.

We know this pandemic has been nothing short of an economic crisis as much as it has been a public health crisis, and that is why I am proud of the work of the New Jersey economic development authority to pump $100 million directly into our small business sector. One of those small businesses we’re proud to have partnered with is Joy’s Hallmark of Marlton, owned by Ron and joy Monokian. They’ve been in business since 1987, helping their customers celebrate holidays, birthdays, weddings, graduations, and frankly, everything else in between. But when the pandemic hit, their store took a hit too. Through the EDA, Ron was able to secure direct grant assistance, which, when paired with the support he received through the federal government, meant the Joy’s Hallmarks employees could be kept on the payroll and that the bills could be paid to keep the store running.',\n",

So while he’s optimistic, he’s still making up for lost time. He’s also, by the way, a member of both the Burlington and Ocean City Chambers of Commerce, and I share his support of all the small business owners who have been working hard to keep their dreams alive throughout this pandemic. We’re going to get through this together and we’re going to come out stronger together. That goes, by the way, not just for our small business community, that goes for each and every one of our entire state. Let’s keep working together to push this virus back down.

These 22 health departments are known as LINCS agencies. LINCS stands for local information network and communications systems. This funding will allow these agencies to hire additional employees to coordinate testing, contact tracing and isolation and quarantine activities in their communities in collaboration with the 99 local health departments. These new positions will provide data management and epidemiological support to all local health departments and contact tracing teams within their areas. They’ll help individuals exposed to COVID with the needs such as housing, food, mental health and medical services and other social supports.

This lingering illness may lead to prolonged absences from work studies or other activities. So researchers are beginning to study the longer term effects of COVID-19. And some studies have indicated that the virus can damage the heart. In addition, there are many anecdotal stories of individuals that had the illness who are still struggling with fatigue and difficulty breathing months later. This should be a sobering reminder to healthy residents, especially young individuals that this disease is serious. You could be battling cough, fatigue, or shortness of breath for weeks or months. Again, there are still a lot we don’t know about the disease and its health effects, so it is not worth taking unnecessary risks.

I want to thank Ed. He is the developer of the dashboard, to provide more context about how COVID-19 unfolded in our state and our counties. Under the tab titled case summary, you can view the trends the governor mentioned. You can also select individual dates and date ranges to see the data more granularly. We are adding data on age adjusted case and mortality rates by race and ethnicity, which allows for a fair comparison between the groups with different age distributions. And earlier this week, we posted a new tab with hospital discharge data broken down by age, gender, race, and ethnicity. That concludes my daily report.

I have begun to get read in more recently, more anecdotal than science- based, a friend Bill Leferett up in Mahwah first raised with me a number of weeks ago, this whole notion of what they’re now calling long haulers as in long haul truckers, but this reality of the lingering health challenges. I mentioned the Red Sox earlier. They’ve got a pitcher right now who’s got an inflamed heart muscle in his heart, but he tested negative now after having tested positive weeks ago. There’s fatigue you mentioned, whole range of challenges, many of which we probably don’t know yet. To your very good point, that creates another health challenge that we’re going to have to collectively deal with obviously, because we’re going to be there for those people. But it’s another reminder that once you get sucked in by this, it could linger in your system, in your body for a long time. So the consequences may God forbid are not life and death, but as we’ve seen with thousands and thousands of folks who have lost their lives, it is an addition to that, you may get through this as most people do, but you may bring with you health realities that could go on for a long time. So thank you for highlighting that. Pat, tropical storm is on our list, which is not COVID, but that’s something that would potentially complicate our lives.

Again, virtual tomorrow and Sunday, unless you hear otherwise. And we’ll be together with you in person at one on Monday. Aswans got the mic. Dustin. Good afternoon.',\n",
              "  'Dustin: (40:15) Do you still stand by the $10 billion figure for projected losses or do you plan to revise that figure? Given some of the fears and anxieties that teachers and faculty have about returning to school in the fall, would you be willing to allow teachers and school workers the option of working remotely as you gave that option to parents for their children? And lastly, on the eviction moratorium, obviously tenants are struggling to pay their rent, but then on the flip side, you have a lot of landlords who haven’t collected rent in six months. Do you have any timeline for ending the moratorium or do you have any plans to address that issue? Thanks.',\n",
              "  'Governor Phil Murphy: (40:56) Thank you, Dustin. I have to say based on what we know, the outside reality is not our problem at the moment and Judy, unless you would see it otherwise we don’t have evidence. And again, there’s a mountain of data that we’re plowing through all the time. We just have not seen the evidence that the outside reality is our problem. It is the inside reality and that is something that we are… it’s no secret at this point because as I’ve said it several times, that is something we’re looking hard at.',\n",
              "  'Governor Phil Murphy: (41:37) I don’t have an update on the $10 billion number, Dustin, but that’s something that we’re going to continue to look at. And boy, I wish we had resolution on the federal cash assistance for states. Not only did they walk away off the bridge of the ship in the Senate, leaving individuals hanging who are barely hanging on by a thread, but you’ve got states all over the country that are barely hanging on by a thread. I think on the educators’ side, by the way, we had a good meeting with some of the leadership and the educators, our team, and their team yesterday. And the districts are in the last stages of putting their plans together. I think we’ll leave that to the district plans and see what they have and what they are actually planning. As we’ve said many times, no two districts are alike.',\n",
              "  'Governor Phil Murphy: (42:33) But one of the asks, a rightful ask of educators has been capacity in the classroom. And one of the ways that we wanted to give relief, not just to parents to give them flexibility and kids at districts, but also as explicitly to educators and that task was to give that remote learning flexibility and option, particularly when we found the resources to close the digital divide. And so that is indirectly not just helping the family and kids where that makes sense, but it’s also helping the educators by lowering capacity. Yeah. I asked the governor last night. The moratorium Matt Plackin is with us, I think will last up to as I recall two months after I declare an end to the health emergency number one, and number two, symmetry has been at the core of a lot of the rental and mortgage holidays and windows that we’ve created.',\n",
              "  'Governor Phil Murphy: (43:36) In other words, if you’re a landlord with a mortgage over here, would ask the mortgage bankers to get off your back and give you a holiday and likewise, that allows you to give the people who are renting from you whether it’s a house or an office or whatever it might be, a holiday on that side. And that symmetry is still at the center of all of the windows that we’ve created. What we don’t want, I was asked this last night, people playing games and going circuitous only through one legal avenue when they know that that has a higher chance of being able to circuit our executive order or secondly, that on day one, following the end of the window whether you’re a renter or you have a mortgage or you’re a mortgage payer, we don’t want and don’t expect that you’re going to have a lump sum payment to make on day one of that post holiday period.',\n",

So that there’s a plan that more than asking or hoping that the mortgage lender or the landlord would behave that way. There is something like for every month that you’ve had a window of you haven’t had to pay your mortgage, you have a six month window to make that up, something like that. Anything you want to add or are you good?',\n",

There’s also behavior that we expect out of folks, but we understand that this is a challenge, I’ve got it, by the way, in my own family. And so, that’s something that is a work in progress. I don’t know Matt, if you want to add anything or you… So, bear with us on that, but that’s part of the legislative fix that we’re trying to get to. You’ve got anything, sir?',\n",

Just as indoor dining, I think… I don’t want to put words in your mouth, but we’ve talked for weeks now about having indoor dining, all the capacity, restrictions, social distancing, hyper hygiene, and liquors… Bar service only to the table as opposed to any gathering around the bar. So, yes, the answer is, when we do get there on gyms, and I say, when we’ll get there, we’ll get there on indoor dining, it will be with some restrictions.',\n",

Where… What’s a red line that we might be at which would trigger potential policy or enforcement steps? I think you should assume we’re there.

Indoor activity, and Judy and all that she has done, and all that we’re trying to do to manage out-of-state travel coming in here in New Jersey, and those who have gone out-of-state coming back in here. We frankly don’t see a whole lot coming from that second reality. It’s… We’re still getting our arms around that, because we’re asking a lot of individuals. It is overwhelmingly, though, indoor activity, high congregation, lack of ventilation. What I would say as a parent or to a parent, and I am a parent, is, a couple of things I’ve already said but I want to repeat because it’s a very good question, don’t expect a normal school year. And I think if you’ve got that expectation, you’re going to be disappointed. This is going to be unusual. Just look at the moment that we’re in, not just as a state, but as a nation and the world, it’s not going to be normal.',\n",
              "  'Governor Phil Murphy: (49:44) Secondly, we will try to get as much flexibility as humanly possible into the system, including reserving the right, based on the data that we’ve just discussed, to make decisions iteratively as we go forward. Thirdly, remember that we have three big principles. Number one, health. Number two, best education possible. Number three, equity. And that gets to a point it depends on who the parent is. Is it a home with an extra room for the kid to easily remote learn, multiple devices? Not both parents aren’t working so they don’t have to worry about putting their living at risk or the daycare challenges that would come from having a child at home. Remember that, on the other hand, there are households, whether it’s… There are two working parents or a single mom or dad, or the circumstances of their density of their living, where the in-person option is the only option. That there’s really… Any plan B is a poor… Either doesn’t exist or it’s a poor substitute for the in-person piece. And I would say, lastly, that we will do it working with the districts, and they’ve done an extraordinary job. We’ll do it as responsibly as possible. So that if you’re in the school, you’re going to see social distancing enforced, face masks and coverings enforced, hyper hygiene, limitations on capacity. However they get there in that district… It depends on the district, because as I’ve said, there’s no two districts alike. But, know that normalcy is not within our grasp right now, let’s all accept that. Let’s take our hats off to everybody, the districts, the supers, the boards, the educators, the parents, the kids themselves, the staff that are all trying to get this right.

And I know the Department of Education would be, forget about me, the Department of Education who are the education experts, and Judy and her team as the health experts, would want to look at that and understand.

We have to repeat again, Judy, it is a big day, notwithstanding the increase in cases, that for the first time in 142 days, we had no deaths in our hospitals, and that cannot be understated or underestimated. Again, as important as that milestone is, it’s a lagging indicator of people who are getting infected plus or minus many weeks ago. But folks, keep doing a great job. Please cut out the indoor gatherings where people are on top of each other, not socially distanced, not wearing face coverings, that’s not going to work.

Before I begin, I want to thank the emergency management personnel throughout the state of Florida. They prepared for Isaias and we did not get the major impact that we were prepared for which is a very good thing, but we did get a good trial run for what will likely be a busy hurricane season. In particular we had the opportunity to beta test the new sheltering strategy which we had to evolve in light of the coronavirus. The state of Florida sent PPE kits and thermometers to all shelters in the storm’s path and arranged for non-congregate sheltering options for people who either had or were suspected of having COVID-19, and it all proved to be very helpful. In Palm Beach for example, we had people show up to a shelter that had tested positive recently or who did not pass the temperature screening and those people redirected to a nearby hotel where they had a safe place to stay until the storm passed. I would just tell Floridians there’s been a lot of activity up to this point in the season. We do anticipate more storms developing so make sure that you have a plan. We’ll hope for the best on this but we absolutely need to be prepared for more storms.',\n",
              "  'Governor DeSantis: (01:54) I’m really glad to be here with Broward Health. We have Gino Santorio, the president/ CEO, we have Josh Lenchus, doctor/chief medical officer, Cheryl Wild, chief nursing officer and Dave Lacknauth, executive director of pharmacy services for Broward Health. They’re going to talk about some of the things that we’ve been working on in conjunction with them. I think that they’ve done a really good job. I think everyone throughout South Florida has done a fantastic job. Frontline healthcare workers in the hospitals in responding to this crisis. We are looking at … I’m going to make an announcement today about testing which I think will be helpful, but we are encouraged by some of the trends we’re seeing. We continue to see a downward trend in visits to the emergency department with people with COVID-like illnesses. We’ve seen a peak in COVID positive patients that are hospitalized statewide happened the third week in July. We’ve continued to see that census decline and I think that that is consistent with what they’ve seen here at Broward Health. Today we reported one of the lowest numbers of tests that we’ve, positive tests that we’ve reported in a long time and we’ve had two days in a row where the positivity has been 9% which we were 15, 16% there for a while.',\n",
              "  'Governor DeSantis: (03:17) These are encouraging trends. Obviously there’s a lot more work to do and one of the reasons why we’re here today is because we want to address the remaining challenges. One is the turnaround time for testing. When we started going to expand testing in May, we thought that if we could get up to 35,000 tests a day that that would really, really be doing well. Remember in March and April, we were doing 7,000, 8,000, 10,000 tests a day. There obviously was a need for more capacity so we worked to do that.',\n",
              "  'Governor DeSantis: (03:50) We have done a lot more than just 35,000. We typically will get in roughly 100,000 test results in a given day. You are also seeing more and more testing throughout the country. The result of that has been turnaround times of a lot of the commercial labs have just been moved to the right more and more. You have longer wait times. Obviously if you’re somebody that is symptomatic and if you don’t get your results back for seven days, that is not helpful. For our asymptomatic test takers, if it takes seven days, then the test is basically useless at that time because even if you were infectious at the minute you tested, by the time you get it back, you probably haven’t been isolating anyways and you’re likely to not be infectious on the backend of that.',\n",
              "  'Governor DeSantis: (04:38) So increasing the times is something that we’re looking to. I asked Jared Moskowitz to make some changes to try to do that, so starting tomorrow, we’re going to have some real positive changes. We’re actually going to convert two of our sites in Miami-Dade County, the Marlins stadium and Hard Rock stadium, to exclusively 15 minute antigen tests. The tests will be for people that have symptoms or for elderly 65 and older. There will still be a lane for the traditional testing for the other asymptomatic people, but that will be the traditional swab with the traditional lab, but for those folks who are older or who are symptomatic or both, you’re going to be able to go in, get the antigen tests, and in 15 minutes, walk out with a result.',\n",
              "  'Governor DeSantis: (05:27) That’s not only good for the test taker and the patient, it’s also good for officials monitoring the trends. When we get tests reported to the state, sometimes those tests were taken 10, 14 days before. Certainly the infections in many cases happened 10 to 14 days before, so if you’re looking at things like the positivity rate or some of these other things, a lot of times that data can be stale. Now we’re going to get every day at these two sites, total of 1,250 tests. We’re going to be able to get realtime data about the percent testing positive, the number of people testing, and so I think it will be really, really good. People want to know and want those results back.',\n",
              "  'Governor DeSantis: (06:11) What every other drive through site throughout the state of Florida, we are going to have symptomatic lanes. This will be people that are experiencing coronavirus symptoms or are 65+ or both and they will be able to self-swab. So they self-swab, we have relationships with certain labs that once we get them the swabs, we usually get a 24-hour turnaround from the time the lab receives it so if we can get it to them as quick as possible, they typically turn it around well. This will be I think very good, so it’s not going to be seven days which is what’s been happening, so hopefully it will be more of a 48 to 72 hour window which I think is a big deal when you’re talking about this and of course there will be a lane for people who are asymptomatic. We’re also going to offer at all these sites antibody testing, and it’s something to think about because think we’ve seen with more of the research and the data that’s come out, particularly over the last few weeks, CDC has now moved to a symptoms based approach for employees going back to work. They’re discouraging needing to get a negative PCR test and I think part of the reason that the antibody test may make sense for people that don’t have symptoms is PCR tests can pick up dead virus CDC says up to 12 weeks but certainly we know people who have tested positive for days and days beyond the 14-day period. That’s not an uncommon thing, so if you’re asymptomatic and you’re testing, we really can’t tell you for sure whether you have live virus once we get those results.',\n",
              "  'Governor DeSantis: (07:50) Now some people may still want to do PCR. It’s going to be there, but the antibody tests, we’ll be able to tell you whether you have the antibodies and whether you have been infected and if you have IGM antibodies, then you likely had a more recent infection. If you have IGG antibodies, likely were infected a little bit further back in the past. So that’s very valuable information for people to know whether they have the antibodies and what we’ve seen is since we opened up antibody testing to the general public, we used to do it for the healthcare workers and for the first responders, we’ve opened it up. We’ve seen the antibody rates increase throughout Florida and some days we’ll 15, 16, 17% of the test takers will be positive for antibodies. Now it’s not scientifically representative because it’s just first come first serve, but I think that there’s a surprising amount of antibodies out there so if folks want to do that, we’re going to be able to do it, but it’s all about lab prioritization, understanding that there is a limited lab capacity for a quick turnaround, and if we can focus on those people who really need the test results the quickest, I think we’re going to be able to improve. So you’re going to have two sites with instant tests and then you’re going to have the other drive through sites with the self',\n",
              "  'Governor DeSantis: (09:03) It’s with instant tests, and then you’re going to have the other drive through sites with the self swab and quicker turnaround at the lab option, which I’m really excited about. We’re also working very closely with all the hospitals throughout the state of Florida. As we look down with this coronavirus crisis, the two things that I think were just so important to get right were doing everything we could to protect the vulnerable, particularly those in longterm care facilities, but then be there to support our frontline healthcare workers and our hospital systems. Remember, when we did the whole flatten the curve in March and April, that was all just to buy time to be able to make sure that the hospital system could cope with the pandemic. And we’ve worked really hard with all the hospitals, as they’ve had needs, we’ve worked really hard to respond with any assistance we can buy.',\n",
              "  'Governor DeSantis: (09:52) So, for example, with this remdesivir which is one of the top therapeutics that doctors are now offering, we’ve gotten 3,500 cases delivered to the state of Florida, which is 143,000 vials. And as hospitals ran low, we had to go to the White House and get the schedule expedited, and be able to get more remdesivir in the hands of our frontline physicians. I think Broward Health, they were going low, and then they got replenished before they ran out and that’s what we were trying to do. We’re also promoting convalescent plasma donations. Hospitals do need this. It’s high demand. It can be an effective treatment. And so we’re going to continue to encourage people throughout the state of Florida to give blood. If you do have the antibodies. If you’ve recovered from an infection to go give the blood.',\n",
              "  'Governor DeSantis: (10:44) That’s one of the reasons having the antibody lanes at these test sites are good, because if you do test positive, you can go get blood and you can help potentially save a life. It’s very, very important. We’re also helping hospitals with personnel. When the pandemic really got hot and heavy in March, the fear that was put out was about running out of hospital beds. That never was really a threat in the state of Florida in March, April, May. But then as we got into and started seeing the prevalence increase admissions, we reached out to hospitals and said, “What do you need? How’s your day bed capacity?” And actually, to a man, they all said the bedroom is great, we just need to make sure should we have enough personnel to staff the beds that we have. And sure enough, that’s been the case.',\n",
              "  'Governor DeSantis: (11:32) We’ve had bed capacity the whole time. Certain areas of the state because of the increased admissions, those frontline workers work extremely, extremely hard, particularly in Dade and Broward. And so we were able to send 1900 medical personnel to hospitals. We have more at my direction that can be deployed. 150 of the personnel are working right here at Broward Health. So these are personnel that we didn’t necessarily use in March and April, May, and the beginning of June, but we had the arrangements in place so that if we needed to do it, we could do it. And I think that that’s been a huge, huge source of help. I mean, the amount of just their lives that they’ve had the juggle, if you’re a frontline healthcare worker throughout the whole time has been tough, but particularly once we saw the increase in prevalence at the end of June throughout July, it’s been very, very difficult.',\n",
              "  'Governor DeSantis: (12:32) And so to be able to provide some level of support there, I think that that’s a very good use of resources and I’m glad we were able to do it. And finally, I think we’re supporting the hospitals, protecting the vulnerable. We have now established 23 COVID exclusive nursing facilities throughout the state. That’s over 1500 beds. And in Broward, we have three COVID exclusive facilities throughout the state or throughout the county with a total of nearly 175 beds. And what that allows you to do; one, it allows you to limit an outbreak in a nursing home. If someone tests positive, they can be safely transferred to a COVID only physical. It also allows a hospital, if they have a longterm care resident who’s medically stable, they know they can’t discharge a sick patient back to the new nursing home because that would obviously create risk of spread, but they can discharge to a COVID exclusive facility. So it helps prevent outbreaks in nursing homes or limit outbreaks in nursing homes and then it also helps the hospitals be able to manage their beds. And if they have patients in there who don’t require hospitalization, if it is an infected nursing home resident, there’s a safe place to transfer where you’re not going to run the risk of furthering the spread. So we really appreciate the facilities here in Broward stepping up to do this. And the hospitals, I think, have worked really well with our secretary, Mary Mayhew. And I think it’s really been successful. We have 1500 beds, almost. There are over 1500, but we have probably hundreds of more that are going to be online. So I want to thank all the healthcare workers throughout the state that have been working tirelessly to support your fellow Floridians in a very difficult time. We appreciate the sacrifice, we’re going to continue to support.',\n",
              "  'Governor DeSantis: (14:22) And remember, there are certain things that all Floridians can do, look out for our vulnerable population, make sure you’re exercising good hygiene, exercising appropriate physical distancing, such as avoiding crowded spaces, closed areas and close contact, and then wearing a facial cover, particularly, if you can’t maintain that six footed difference. Floridians have really stepped up to the plate and done a great job. As I said, got a lot of work to do. Trends are a lot better today than they were a month ago. So we want to build on that success and if we do it with one goal as one Florida, I’m confident we’re going to be able to get that done. So it’s an honor for me to be able to introduce our, CEO Gino Santorio from Broward Health. So, Gino.',\n",
              "  'Gino Santorio: (16:23) In addition to the state effectively getting us some of the necessary drugs that have made a significant impact in the survivability such as remdesivir, they’ve also helped us in an area that is a significant need across the state, which was staffing. We currently, in our system, have 131 employees that are a combination of respiratory therapists, nurses, and certified nursing assistants, which have been able to help supplement our own staff to be able to ensure that we can effectuate a surge above and beyond what current numbers are today should we have needed them. We would never, as a safety net hospital, turn away a patient. Safety nets in the state of Florida represent about 12% of the hospitals yet we’ve treated over 50% of the COVID hospitalized patients. And a lot of the resources that enable us to do that have come not just from the state and internally, but have come at a very rapid turnaround.',\n",
              "  'Gino Santorio: (18:03) [inaudible 00:18:00] nursing facilities have had testing of both the residents and the caregivers on a consistent basis. You heard the governor speak about our COVID only facilities that have been stood up. That has been an absolute, huge success factor in survivability of COVID, and maintaining a low mortality rate. So, very pleased to report that. I do want to encourage, and we’ve joined our hospital partners as well as additional healthcare partners in South Florida to come together. We launched a campaign called caringforsouthflorida.org that encourages, and really follows suit with the One Florida campaign from the governor’s office to really encourage, and maintain the diligence around social responsibility, social distancing, masking, et cetera.',\n",

              "  'Dave Lacknauth: (19:54) They are on call for us night, day, weekends, anytime they are there for us. Our infectious disease physicians as well, same thing. They are on call, they’re on board, they’re working with us to drive what I call that clinical bus in making sure we have the right therapies for supportive care around COVID. The care that we provide for COVID for our patients that are hospitalized is critical, and important. In this day and age, what we find out is the one thing we understand is everything changes every day. Data comes out tomorrow that we didn’t see today, data is going to come out in two weeks that we don’t know from tomorrow.',\n",
              "  'Dave Lacknauth: (21:18) They were able to ensure we got what we needed, when we needed it to ensure our patients had the supplies and medication portfolio that they would need for our clinicians to then administer care. Again, I just want to keep it brief with an overview of what we’re doing clinically to support our patients that come into Broward Health. If you do come into Broward Health for COVID or non-COVID issues, our clinical teams are here to support you, and you will receive the best care that we can possibly give to you with the most up to date information. I’m going to hand over now to [Dr. Lunches 00:00:21:55]. He’s our chief medical officer for Broward Health Medical Center to expand on a little bit more.',\n",
              "  'Dr. Lunches: (22:49) The patient’s outcomes of course are predicated on our knowledge of the ever evolving landscape of COVID-19, as you heard Dave Lacknauth talk about. We do use things like remdesivir, convalescent plasma is used so long as we can get it, and you’ve heard really what we need the most though, is for the community to help us help them, and the way that they could do that is by adhering to the pivotal components of the governor’s platform where we protect the vulnerable, where you wear your mask, where you do hand hygiene, and where you physically distance.',\n",
              "  'Cheryl Wilde: (23:50) I am Cheryl Wilde. I represent nursing for the facilities in Broward Health. I would just like to say that I very much support what my clinical partners have just said. The care that we’re giving the patients is amazing. The caregivers, I cannot stand here without thanking them. The caregivers, the nursing teams, the respiratory therapists, everyone who’s come out to really give everything that they have this last five months or so has been very challenging for them. I cannot thank the governor, and the state enough for the support that they’ve given us, the staffing, and the nursing who have really just come out, and help to support our system. The care that we’re giving our patients, again, is top rate. Our outcomes have been very, very good, and I’m just very, very thankful for all the support that we have received from the state at this point.',\n",
              "  'Governor DeSantis: (24:49) Well, thanks so much. We really appreciate all the hard work. I think the average member of the public understands that people in health care often have to work hard, and I think that they assume that in a situation like that, that’s even doubly, but dealing with an infectious disease like this really is labor intensive, because even if you guys have someone in a car accident, they swab positive, you’ve got to do all kinds of procedures to isolate, to make sure that you’re keeping it from spreading throughout your facility. It requires a lot of folks to work a lot of hours, work very hard. Obviously, you have PPE and everything, but none of that is foolproof, so people are potentially exposing themselves as patients come in.',\n",
              "  'Governor DeSantis: (25:33) Although, I think the track record has been really good with our healthcare workers in terms of using that equipment. It’s been a real challenge, and I think that the folks really have stepped up, done a great job. We are happy to be able to provide some support, and we’re going to continue to keep that support going for as long as you need it. I’m encouraged about your trends. I think that, that’s a really good sign. We look at all these different things. This number of tests, or that, but some of that is based on how many people you’re testing? What’s your testing criteria? When are the labs reporting all this?',\n",
              "  'Governor DeSantis: (26:07) But, the people showing up at the emergency department, or the people that are being admitted or discharged here, that’s just the reality of what the disease is doing, and I think the fact that they’re either discharging people, they’re generating a lot of positive outcomes compared to what you would have seen in February and March, either in the United States, or in other parts of the world. That’s really, really encouraging, and we’re obviously excited to be able to provide remdesivir, work with the White House to do that, and as other things come down the pike, we want to continue to be helpful.',\n",
              "  'Governor DeSantis: (26:40) But, we are here to help South Florida. We really appreciate. It’s been a challenge for the whole state, don’t get me wrong. The first kind of time we had South Florida, and then, the rest of the state was relatively modest in terms of the prevalence. This time, I think everyone saw more prevalence, but of course, here in Broward and Miami-Dade, you’ve seen the most, and so, I really appreciate how great everyone’s responded.',\n",
              "  'Governor DeSantis: (27:03) … you’ve seen the most. And so I really appreciate how great everyone’s responded with that. I’m happy to take a question or two. Yes, ma’am?',\n",
              "  'Governor DeSantis: (27:15) I got tested like two days ago, so I’m not sure when that would have happened or whatnot. So I’m tested regularly, and I don’t have, or have not had any symptoms. So the number of times I’ve been tested has been pretty significant, and I’ve had my temperature checked probably a hundred times just in the last few months. Yes ma’am?',\n",
              "  'Governor DeSantis: (27:38) Is that Glenna? Oh, hi.',\n",
              "  'Governor DeSantis: (27:57) This is for the longterm care isolation centers? Okay.',\n",
              "  'Governor DeSantis: (28:33) Yep. Well, a couple of things. One is the family should be notified if a family member is transferred to an isolation center. I thought that that was being done, but I’m going to look to see, because they need to. Obviously, if there’s a positive case, the nursing homes are required to notify the families with that, but they should also do that.',\n",
              "  'Governor DeSantis: (28:55) So these isolation centers are following all the CDC guidelines. They have negative pressure, they have to be able to do that in order to get approved by AHCA. So as long as they’re following those rules, it’s going to be safe, and if somebody is COVID-positive and is put there, they are not allowed to be mixed, if you do have a situation like that, with the general population, of course not. That would defeat the whole purpose of doing the transfer in the first place. Because if we’re going to do that, we could have just left them in the nursing facilities. The nursing facilities, we do have many just regular nursing facilities that have the ability to isolate. We have 4,000 plus, most of them don’t have that ability. Some do. So if you have the ability to isolate, and you have a positive test or two, you can isolate the residents appropriately. And obviously not allow that to get into the general public. But for those, which are the majority, who do not have the capability of isolating, they’re required to be transferred to a place that can be safely isolated. Sometimes that’s hospitals. And when we were in April and May, we would see a lot of transfers, but when the patient is not requiring hospitalization to have a COVID-only nursing facility where they can safely isolate, convalesce, and then be discharged safely back is a really good tool.',\n",
              "  'Governor DeSantis: (30:23) But I think the families, they need to be kept apprised on that. So I’m going to talk to Secretary Mayhew and make sure that that’s the case. Believe me, there’d be no reason to transfer anyone unless it was necessary for safety. But I think as we found, that when you have these outbreaks that run unchecked in a nursing facility you are going to see major clinical consequences for that in terms of hospitalizations, and unfortunately in terms of a longterm care facility resident deaths. Yes sir?',\n",
              "  'Governor DeSantis: (31:17) So I haven’t talked to the White House. But I’ve tried to say from the beginning, well certainly over the last few months when it became apparent, the number one source of outbreaks is in the home. And so that becomes a specific challenge… My house, my wife and I, I got young kids, we’re not in the risk categories, but you’ve got a lot of families in Florida where you’ll have multi generational living, or even if they’re not under the same roof, particularly you look like a county like Miami-Dade, you just have a lot of family that live in the area, and they’re getting together. They’re doing what normal families do. The risk, and either if you’re under the same roof the whole time or if you’re in close contact, is that those more vulnerable relatives, whether it’s a parent, a grandparent, an uncle, they then can be exposed by younger people who may not be visibly demonstrating symptoms.',\n",
              "  'Governor DeSantis: (32:10) And so I think it’s something that people should absolutely look at, whether it’s the mask, whether it’s isolation. I think there’s a lot of different ways, but just to understand protecting our vulnerable, part of that is if you’re in those vulnerable groups you need to do what you can do to avoid crowds, to protect yourself. But everyone else also has a responsibility to govern themselves accordingly where they’re not providing any type of a danger to them.',\n",
              "  'Governor DeSantis: (32:41) But I would also say though, the physical distancing, avoiding the close contact in an enclosed environment, that should not be put aside. So you’re going to do the mask in addition to that, but just understand if you’re in very close sustained contact, particularly with some of those cloth masks, you don’t have a hundred percent protection of the droplets. You’re talking about it will intercept hopefully some, hopefully most, but certainly not all. So people shouldn’t have a false sense of security on that. You still got to do the sanitation. You still got to do the physical distancing.',\n",
              "  'Governor DeSantis: (33:58) So in terms of the education, our primary policy is that parents should have a choice if they want to do distance learning because they don’t want in-person instruction right now, they should have the ability to do that.',\n",
              "  'Governor DeSantis: (34:12) But then for the many parents who really do believe that their kids need to be in the classroom, we want that choice as well. The Department of Education is working in conjunction with the Department of Health, with districts on a district-by-district basis, and they are also working with their local county health departments to be able to devise the best safety plans.',\n",
              "  'Governor DeSantis: (34:32) I think that there’s a number of things that they may have in common. But I also think that a plan in Miami-Dade may look a little bit different than some of the other counties, which may be more rural, and may have less prevalence. But I’d also say that we are happy to see single-digit positivity statewide for two days in a row. We had been mired in 15, 16%. We did have it go down to 11, 12, and then to see this decline, I hope that that trend continues. I think people have really been doing their part to make sure that it does.',\n",

            "['and new jersey port authority whos doing been doing an extraordinary job the port authority does among other things the administration of the airports building the new john f kennedy rebuilding jfk so hes been doing double duty and we have a great announcement today that we joined in this morning which im going to chat about in a moment todays day for those who are counting if youre not counting its still date number of hospitalizations what does that number mean it is a new low since we were in the midst of the battle so that is great news number of covid patients in icu also a new low since the height of the crisis number of intubations also a new low so thats great news number of lives lost a new low on the three day average three people passed away yesterday so this is really all great great news and i congratulate new yorkers because this is purely a result of the actions that theyve been taking the progress is even better than we expected remember when we started reopening all the experts said expect the infection rate to increase when the activity rate increases thats what youve seen all across the country thats what youve seen in other countries and thats what we expected here we then were talking about calibrating the increase and making sure it didnt go that high but it was supposed to go up after two two and a half months of reopening the numbers have actually gone down which nobody suggested and that is really to compliment new yorkers we started reopening may th thats where it was on the curve you call it a curve i call it a descent of the mountain we get to the same place we just have different metaphorical images but thats where the reopening started since the reopening the numbers continue to go down no expert predicted that so new yorkers are doing better than anyone else even expected cautious still well why shouldnt we be celebrating because look around thats why look at whats going on across the country look at those increases look at what were dealing with in terms of now states on the quarantine list and look at incidents of lack of compliance the numbers are a result of the actions and we have been disciplined and we have to stay disciplined in terms of enforcement local governments have to do a better job i dont know how else to say it were doing everything we can on the state side the sla and the state police are working double duty we have a problem with young people and lack of compliance we have a problem especially at bars and restaurants last night they did another violations they checked establishments over the weekend they checked establishments ', 'and did violations all this to say to the bars and restaurants follow the rules because if you dont follow the rules chances are likelihood is someones going to be there to watch and to check and thats the way it should be if youre following the rules fine if youre not following the rules if i were you i would be worried and thats the way it should be were seeing continued situations that are just not intelligent and local governments have to crack down on these whether theyre in new york city or long island or theyre in upstate new york how a charter boat could put together a crowd on deck and leave its just disrespectful its illegal it not only violates public health it violates common decency look at all the people you endangered what if one of those people on that cruise gets sick and dies what if the one of those people on that cruise get sick and goes home and gives it to a parent who dies i mean it is just really reckless rude irresponsible and illegal under the inaudible bridge apparently dozens of people partying we need better enforcement all across the state on the issue of schools i want to be clear we have school districts in this state the districts are putting in plans on how they will handle the reopening ill make a determination later this week on the infection rate whether or not were going to reopen schools but just because a district puts out a plan doesnt mean that if we reopen the school parents are going to come or teachers are going to come its not well the government said the schools are open now everybody must go its not going to happen that way im talking to parents i am telling you it is not going to happen that way they are not going to trust the school district this is an issue of public health just because the school district says you shouldnt worry about your childs public health thats not going to be enough not in this environment not when youre dealing with situations that everybody knows that nobody has the facts parents are going to want to understand the information for themselves ill tell you what theyre asking me ill tell you what theyre going to ask every school district how are you going to test how many tests are you going to take are you sure you have them lined up are you sure those are enough tests is it a representative sample how long is it going to take to turn around the tests is it two days four days seven days theyre informed parents theyre the most informed people on this issue probably in the country theyve lived through it theyre going to have questions this is not going to be the school district puts out a plan and then by ', 'fiat by dictatorship that is the plan you need the parents to be comfortable you need the teachers to be comfortable you need the children to show up at school and theres going to have to be a discussion you look at some of these plans theyre indecipherable even if you can understand the plan they raise questions and parents are going to need to talk it through i encourage every school district set up a discussion room now start explaining to the parents now have those conversations now you cant call people into a conference room but you can invite them onto a video chat or onto a chat room but they have questions and they need answers and time is short that should start now because the parents are going to make the decision nobodys going to tell them me whether or not i should send my child to school im going to make that determination and im going to want to make sure its an informed determination and im not going to trust just whats on some school districts plan im not going to do that and parents have to be comfortable and they should be comfortable because they are the ultimate decision makers here just because i say the infection rate is low thats not going to cause a parent to send the child back to school just because of the school district says we have a safe plan im telling you its not going to work they have to feel comfortable which means they have to be part of the process we have to have a dialogue i want to congratulate the port authority rick cotton who runs it chairman kevin otoole the saint nicholas greek church has been a long saga for new york was destroyed in it was supposed to be rebuilt there were fits and starts bureaucracy was slow this was slow but i was just with his eminence the archbishop and it is now being rebuilt it is magnificent it really is a beautiful structure it is the only church on part of the only church on part of it is going to be a bereavement center its not just a greek church its a universal center for reconciliation it is a spiritual place and weve been trying to get it done for a long time sometimes god works in funny ways that it is now being rebuilt at this moment all these years after why this moment maybe because god says he needs or wants a symbol of renewal and rebirth at this moment maybe it was gods way of saying to new yorkers yes this is a tough time yes weve been dealt a hard blow but we can rise up we can build back and we can build back better st nicholas is better than the church that was there before we didnt just rebuild st nicholas this is a vastly improved physical structure from what it was this is going to be a', ' national landmark st nicholas when its done and i think theres a symbolism there for all new yorkers were going to have to build back theres no doubt about it we dont even understand the extent of the economic damage that has been done and its going to be hard im telling you that but weve done it before well do it again and thats what st nicholas said to me today when i was there in terms of the national situation and i want to speak plain truth on this we said we have two threats we have the lack of compliance and we have the national situation the national situation is getting worse its not getting better that is a fact as i like to say its an inarguable fact you look at the numbers look at whats happening in florida look at california look at texas look at the numbers look at whats happening all across the midwest where youre seeing a dramatic rise look at what the white house is now saying where you entered a new phase of covid whats the new phase extensive spread oh thats the new phase what was the old phase if the new phase is extensive spread what was the old phase that was limited spread what we went through i mean its absurd its not a new phase it was entirely predictable it was the progression of a virus its exponential increase which is what a virus does one person affects two people two people infect four it is the exponential pyramid of viral spreads its not a new phase it was a mathematical equation that you just have to factor out you have medical experts who are now saying we should hit the reset button that the nation should shut down and start over that thats the only way to stop the virus thats what medical experts are saying hit the reset button shut down everything and start all over again thats a damning commentary on where we are hit the reset button just close all the states and start over look you want to start over you want to hit the reset button ill tell you how we hit the reset button in this country we start this time with the truth we do something different than was done in this country six months ago when this started start with the truth tell the american people the truth and it starts on a reset with the president of the united states telling the truth which he did not do six months ago and if you want to hit the reset button and you need to hit the reset button and i believe we need to hit the reset button then hit the reset button but do it honestly and it has to start with the president telling the american people the truth the truth is it was a mistake to deny covid it was a mistake to downplay covid it was a mistake to say its just the fl', 'u it was a mistake to say its gone by easter it was a mistake to say its going to magically disappear when it gets warm it was a mistake to say i see the light at the end of the tunnel it was a mistake to say yes were going to do testing but i dont think we need it those were all mistakes those were all untruths and they sent the wrong message to the american people because some people heard the president and believed him and if you believed him you wouldnt take covid seriously and if you didnt take covert seriously then you wouldnt take the precautions that people were saying you should take but thats what the president of the united states was saying six months ago the president of the united states said five months ago reopen the economy liberate the states liberate the economy his governors are slowwalking reopening theyre just playing politics thats what theyre doing theres no reason not to reopen the economy hurry up hurry up hurry up florida jumps texas jumps arizona jumps yes were just going to reopen the economy that was a mistake it was an untruth it denied the science it denied what theyre saying now the virus will spread if you do that tell the truth the truth is it was a mistake that when you saw what was going on in new york five months ago you didnt heed the warning it was a mistake when you saw the spike in new york you thought somehow those people were different and your people were immune your people arent immune new yorkers had no different immune system that made them more contagious to the virus it was a mistake to deny the reality that happened in new york that was broadcast across the country that was a mistake it was a mistake to see what we had to do here in new york the testing the hospital system the contact tracing the close down the phase reopening and pay no attention to it no attention to it six months later these states still dont have testing and contact tracing how can it be you had six months here in new york we had two weeks we were ambushed because the virus came from europe and nobody told us these other states at six months how did you not set up a testing operation how did you not expand the capacity of your hospital system how did you not locate additional staff how did you not locate additional ppe you had six months the reason they didnt because they were listening to the president there is no issue there is no problem it was a mistake tell them the truth the truth is covid is serious it is deadly serious and its deadly serious for all of us its not deadly serious for democrats its not deadly serious for blue states only covid kills re', 'publicans and covid affects red states it is deadly serious it was not a political issue and it shouldnt have been politicized this is not a political issue and it shouldnt have been politicized this is public health thats what this was and it should have never been turned into a political symbol which is what this president did start with the truth and the truth is an outbreak anywhere is an outbreak everywhere thats what we should have learned in china thats where we should have learned from mers and sars and ebola and swine flu and hn an outbreak anywhere is an outbreak everywhere and its still true and the truth is none of us are safe until all of us are safe that is the truth if we dont tell the truth on the reset covid will never end and it will ricochet across the country it will just bounce back and forth you see how its bouncing now its ricocheting its florida its texas its the midwest its california oh its back to new jersey is on the rise oh its back to massachusetts is on the rise it will continue this ricocheting across the country because thats what viruses do it will never end this was a colossal blunder how covid was handled by this federal government colossal blunder shame on all of you six months shame on all of you six months lives lost hit the reset button yes but the way the medical experts are talking about it it wont work it wont work unless you hit the reset button and you start with the truth because if the american people are continued lying to the confusion and the chaos and the denial will continue hit the reset button its called the truth its called the plain truth the american people are smart if the president actually tells them the truth and says i made a mistake hes not going to be telling them anything they dont know every american knows he made a mistake every american knows this was the worst government blunder in modern history not since the vietnam war have american sat in their living room to see the numbers on the tv screen every night saying what a mistake it was during the vietnam war every night you saw the death toll you saw the injury toll on tv every night theyve seen this virus increasing all across the country and the death toll going up you dont think they know it was a mistake then you dont know the american people they are smarter than you think trust the american people and if you dont trust them and you dont trust their intelligence and you dont trust their ability to handle the information then you shouldnt ask to be their leader i trust the people of new york i told them the truth i told them the facts i never sugar coated ', 'i never shielded i told them the truth so they knew what to do and they did it thats what we call being new york tough and smart and united and disciplined and loving they should try it in washington questions i dont know the status of the individual school plans sed is looking at that state health officials are looking at that my point is different my point is this is not going to be between a school district and the state or a school district and the state education department this is between the school district and the parents the ultimate decision maker are the parents and i dont hear enough about the parents concerns and the parents involvement and the dialogue with the parents its not going to be school district to the state school district to the sed yeah im not going to allow any school to open that i dont believe if we dont have a safe environment thats not going to happen and i think new yorkers know that by the way that doesnt mean that school is safe it doesnt mean the school theyre going to send their kid to is safe and by the way all they care about is the school that their kid is going to oh its very nice the infection rate is good in my region thats nice how about my kids school thats all i care about and just because you send me a form that says it has been determined that school is safe to return to no its not enough its not enough for me i want to review the plan i want to understand the plan i have questions that i want to ask theyre asking me the questions i mean theyre good questions the school district is going to test how many tests how many kids do you have how many tests is that a representative sample how long is it going to take you to get the test returns do you know where are you going to find these tests you dont have them now where are they going to come from all the information says the test results are coming back slower youre going to get them done faster how i mean these are smart people with good questions and youre talking about my childs health marcia were going to approve an infection rate that says from an infection rate point of view the environment is safe to open the school thats all im going to say i am not saying ps is safe in the city i dont even think the plan speaks to ps and thats what the teacher what the parents are going to want to talk about is ps well if there is not sed is supposed to review that and the state department of health and if it is clearly on its face not safe then it wont be approved but my point is marcia i dont care what any bureaucrat says i trust the parents more than anyone and i dont care if a school dis', 'trict says reopen if they dont have a good plan for reopening no kids are going to come and no teachers are going to come so then you have no reopening so youre talking to yourself well where you have a district with multiple schools they have to address the plan for every school now youd have to have a uniform plan you could have a uniform plan for every school every school will have of its students tested on a weekly basis that comes out to tests im getting those tests from quest lab theyre required theyre going to be there by the contract it says quest lab will do the tests the turnaround time will be two days if the child is positive within two days that child will be removed for hours you know youre going to need that level of specificity i havent seen the city plan i dont review the actual plans but if you dont have the details for each school then you dont have a plan because how can a parent make a decision and its not just new york city you know its any school district im talking to parents all across the state and the questions im giving you are verbatims from parents right theyre what you would ask theyre what i would ask and well we have a additional information no we dont ive been doing these briefings for a lot of days people know the questions about this issue were not talking about some normal government issue taxes budgets roads this is their life they know what theyre talking about great question and its the number one question any parent is going to ask what is the representative sample lets say the universe is million what does your health department say is a representative sample you need to test what percent of that million to be meaningful on what basis and then how do you do it thats why im saying the conversation is going to be all about the details pete it doesnt make sure this is done safelike it doesnt because i dont think theres anything unexpected there i dont think the indiana school district is unexpected i dont think that georgia camp is unexpected thats why we didnt open camps i dont think the israel experience with schools is unexpected we know this point we knew this six months ago we knew all of this six months ago thats why its so frustrating that were still talking about this at such a level of ignorance and denial and were so woefully unprepared i mean i was in savannah i was talking to the mayor of st petersburg we still dont know that we have to do tests and we dont have that set up but anyway you have a large congregation of people you put them in a place its the new rochelle superspreader its the new rochellesuper spreader our first w', 'eek one person goes to a congregation goes to a wedding ceremony infects dozens school is no different so i dont care what the building looks like it doesnt matter school church temple mosque cafeteria restaurant its all the same so is there the potential between now and the opening of school if you see things happening what you describe and you say i cannot in good conscience allow schools to open up for now pull the plug for now case closed it would take to one of two things either a the infection rate would have to go up where you knew you were dealing with a highly charged environment or two a particular school district wouldnt have an acceptable plan i believe the unacceptable plan is going to be determined more by the parents and the teachers we have million students lets say in new york city okay so you have roughly how many parents to million you have to million people looking at that plan theyre going to determine if its safe theyre going to blow the whistle and then if a school does not have a safe plan then we wouldnt allow it to open the problem is youre not dealing with an absolute its going to be a relative decision not opening schools is also highly highly problematic you know that you were affecting socialization issues for children you know that you may be subjecting some children to a dangerous situation at home you know you may be aggravating food insecurity that children cant eat you know that you will be aggravating the disparity between wealthier households and poorer households because remote learning is not an equalizer it is a separator it works better where you have two parents at home with a wealthier household that has technology et cetera so neither option is perfect it is a relative decision i dont know that anyone has looked at the plans some plans have not come in some plans are too top line to actually answer the questions because these are the questions if a plan doesnt answer these questions the plan is not sufficient so some plans are in that category i know theyre talking to districts many of the districts have said oh ill send more detail so we dont even really have the plans they sent in a top line and now they have to send in the actual details because the devil is in the details theres no top line here the top line is easy i can open the schools everybodys going to be safe im going to do testing im going to do cohorting have a nice day but i dont believe theyve gotten to the point where they have declined any program and i dont believe sed has even started really looking through them i dont run sed its a state agency everybody thinks im ', 'responsible im not the state education department is totally separate im not going to let washington off the hook they have to deliver they have to deliver we have federal representatives we have senators and we have congress people we pay them to pass a piece of legislation thats going to help new york and its simple if the legislation is not going to help new york you know what i say to them dont pass it it cant pass without you it cant pass without you dont pass a piece of legislation that doesnt restore new yorks funds if you pass a piece of legislation that requires new york to raise taxes raise a millionaires tax in this economic environment in new york city where were struggling we used to be worried millionaires tax people might leave no no no the burden shifted were trying to get people to come back were trying to get them to come back covid is under control were going to make progress helping the homeless were going to clean up the graffiti were going to fix crime on top of that you want to say and by the way when you come back you even get a big tax increase our population of the population pays of the taxes and theyre the most mobile people on the globe i literally talk to people all day long who are now in their hamptons house who also lived here or in their hudson valley house or in their connecticut weekend house and i say you got to come back when are you coming back well go to dinner ill buy you a drink come over ill cook theyre not coming back right now and you know what else theyre thinking if i stay there they pay a lower income tax because they dont pay the new york city surcharge so that would be a bad place if we had to go there senators congresspeople dont pass a bill that hurts new york again and by the way their argument is so easy the federal government caused the new york state problem it was the negligence of the federal government how did they not know the virus went from china to europe and came to new york how did they not know that department of homeland security cdc nih all these federal agencies all this taxpayer money nobody said oh the virus is in china in december maybe itll infect someone who gets on a plane nobody thought that december january february nobody thought in three months that the virus might be traveling after mers after sars which also happened in china from a wet market a poultry market and came to the united states nobody thought oh this might be like every other past viral transmission it was the federal negligence and now theyre not going to pay for the damage they did dont vote for the bill dont vote for the bill have a ']\n",
            "['in the thereafter not only his operation warp speed accelerating the development of a vaccine were also directing a colossal industrial mobilization to ensure its rapid delivery nothings happened like this since the end of world war ii instead of the usual sequence of vaccine development testing and trials followed by production our strategy is to conduct these phases simultaneously so everything goes at one time were not waiting and waiting and waiting its all going at one time we have a system that has i think its unparalleled has never been done before but we suspect its going to work and work very well were massproducing all of the most promising vaccine candidates in advance so that on the day one that its approved it will be available to the american people immediately and well probably have a lot for a lot of other people throughout the world the world is suffering from this china virus another dimension of operation warp speed is our focus on therapeutics to treat the virus over including remdesivir which is having a tremendous impact you see that with mortality rates and other things statistically dexamethazone convalescent plasma and antibody treatments we have numerous treatments right now that are under study i think over the next couple of weeks we may actually have some very positive answers as to that on july th we announced a million agreement with regeneron to begin advanced manufacturing of its antibody treatment which is currently in ', 'late stage clinical trials late stage due to the medical advances weve already achieved and our increased knowledge in how to treat the virus the mortality rate for patients over the age of is lower than it was in april think of that and its lower than europe as a whole in the middle of april more than of all deaths in the united states were attributable to the china virus as the last week that number has dropped down as of last week its dropped down to under to decrease the turnaround times for testing the first two laboratories have been approved to provide pooled testing very important in other words samples from multiple patients are processed together they are pooled now pool testing will reduce turnaround times by more than substantially more than last week our centers for medicare and medicaid services began distributing rapid point of care diagnostic test instruments to all of the nursing homes in the united states focusing on the areas of greatest need which is our elderly and our nursing homes what weve already sent includes testing instruments to nursing homes for rapid point of care tests its a tremendous amount thats youll get your response and answer from five to minutes over the next three weeks nursing homes will receive an additional point of care tests think of that the united states has conducted over million tests thats more than all of europe put together times two nobodys even close and as countries go it is as an example india is ', 'up to million tests were going to be very shortly at million tests india has billion people through our relentless efforts weve completely rebuilt our stockpile which the previous administration depleted and did not refill the cupboards were bare i say it often in total weve now distributed nearly masks million surgical masks million face yields and much much more in addition to that ventilators the most difficult thing of all we are now building thousands a month and well distribute them we have all we need in our country but to other countries that are in desperate need other countries are having a tremendously difficult time with the virus last week fema sent additional personnel protective equipment to over nursing homes including pairs of protective eyewear million masks million pairs of gloves and million gowns its a lot over the weekend cases in florida texas and arizona held steady and are now heading down in arizona theyre heading very substantially down and rapidly weve been constant and in constant communication with the states and are surging them resources when requested they largely had what they needed but anything they need we send them immediately we are totally full we have everything we need we get it to the states immediately we deal with the governors the relationship with the governors has been very good these states are not out of the woods but rigorous compliance with guidelines should allow them to turn the corner and very very ', 'quickly we are working with every and health commissioner across the country to bring a complete individualized analysis to each state as well as tailored recommendation states are different my administration is also closely monitoring the surging caseload in latin america which is now the region in the world with the most active reported infections by far due to the relative scarcity of testing in latin america however the regions reported number of cases is also likely to be dramatically undercut or undercounted i can say thats probably true throughout the entire world we report our cases most of the world doesnt they either dont do testing therefore they have very few cases even though people are sick or they just dont report given the reality of what we just said were focusing aggressively on the texas border and countries that we think have to be watched very very carefully because you have some very very highlyinfected countries outside of our borders ive spoken with abbott terrific gentlemen and i can report that over federal personnel are on the ground in texas weve given them a tremendous amount of extra help including doctors nurses frontline people weve supplied texas with more than million gloves goggles surgical gowns million surgical masks million n respirators and half a million kn masks beginning this week texas hospitals will receive cases of remdesivir which has proven very effective enough to treat patients in addition to the cross bo', 'rder spread the stage of the pandemic is being fueled by younger americans who generally have little risk of being seriously harmed by the disease but can spread the disease we need all americans to be conscious about their actions and to exercise extreme vigilance i trust all americans to do the right thing but we strongly advise everyone to especially especially focus on maintaining a social distance maintaining rigorous hygiene avoid large gatherings and crowded indoor bars and wear masks when appropriate we also strongly urge citizens to take extra precautions to shield those at highest risk which are in most cases in many cases the elderly especially the elderly with medical problems such as heart or diabetes but you want to shield them and you want to guard them and you want to protect them from the virus especially especially those that are really targeted almost targeted you could say by this horrible horrible plague this horrible epidemic pandemic america will develop a vaccine very soon and we will defeat the virus we will have it delivered in record time as our visit here demonstrates i want to thank all of the people and representatives from the great state of north carolina is a great place its a phenomenal place weve had so many great meetings and such a great time i want to drive into the drive and tenacity of your representatives and your politicians has been incredible when they call im there when they call most of them many of them are', ' sitting here right now i will always answer their call thank you very much i appreciate you being here with us and lets get onto a few questions tremendous progress has been made and its been made rapidly and its been made in areas that nothing like that has taken place before please thank you very much thank you thank you well i think so but there would be not that same kind of hope if we werent doing so well where before just before i left the white house in the oval office we had a meeting with our doctors scientists some others and theyre making tremendous progress with respect to therapeutics i can tell you therapeutically i think over the next couple of weeks well have some really very good things to say were just having great answers it is about that its also the vaccine that we discussed today at even greater length is just coming along really well its not just one company its many companies have had tremendous progress thatll be announced over the next very short period well i heard very positive things but by the end of the year we think were in very good shape to be doing that by the end of this year were going to in terms of the vaccine i think in terms of therapeutics even sooner than that therapeutics meaning you go and you give somebody whether its transfusion or shots or whatever it may be and they heal and they heal quickly weve had tremendous progress we already have if you look at remdesivir and you look at some of the other things b', 'ut well have some announcements on that over the next two weeks yeah it is hope but its only hope because weve gotten such incredible results scientifically yeah we dont talk about what we discussed but we had plenty of discussion and i think it was very productive please i dont think so i think the recovery has been very strong weve set record job numbers weve set record numbers whether its a pure v or a little bit less than that i think its going to be very good if therapeutically we come up with some answers very quickly which i think we will then youre going to have a tremendous recovery likewise with the vaccines if you do that by the end of the year thats ahead of schedule substantially ahead of schedule and its ahead of anything thats ever taken place in terms of vaccines before i think if those things happen if just one of those events happen youll go right back into that v and i think youre probably in the v anyway i really do believe a lot of the governors should be opening up states that theyre not opening well see what happens with them but a lot will have to do with the fact that therapeutically i think youre going to have some great answers vaccinewise likewise yeah please go ahead in the back well were actually coming to north carolina as you know were having a very major i guess that would be the nomination night thats a monday thatll be monday theyre going to be here and the rest well do in a different form we could have done it many di', 'fferent ways but i think we did the right thing and im really happy that were going to be having a piece of it at least in a very important piece in north carolina yes please go ahead i think the poll numbers are very good the poll numbers we have are very good were leading in north carolina were leading in pennsylvania were leading in arizona our numbers were leading in arizona were leading nicely in florida i think our poll numbers are very good were leading substantially in georgia i mean we get a lot of suppression polls we get a lot of fake polls just like we have fake news i mean its a terrible thing when you look at it but i had the same thing four years ago i was losing everywhere i had poll numbers where i wasnt going to win any state i ended up winning every one of them the swing states i wasnt going to win any of them and i want all of them i have the same thing this year this year they have it even closer they have it closer but its the same suppressiontype polls we have polls that show me leading in almost every swing state and substantially in other states by even more than i won in when you look at florida as an example you have thousands of boats out of the ocean out on the intercoastal you look at other states where likewise you have thousands of boats and their all waving the sign trumppence sign and theyre so proud thousands and thousands you have seen it where you have bikers for with lines that are miles long on highways going along', ' on weekends i think theres more spirit now than theres ever been for my campaign that includes where obviously there was great enthusiasm great spirit we had great spirit i think theres more today because what weve done nobodys ever done before nobody has ever rebuilt the military cut taxes the most in our history created the greatest economy weve ever had cut regulations at a level that nobodys ever done all of these different things the va we got va choice we got va everything for the va right now they had a approval rating in a recent poll i was just speaking to the secretary in the va thats never happened before i think when people see all that weve done even space force we created a force that actual army navy air force marines right its pretty amazing coast guard now space force that hasnt happened in years what weve done working with some of those warriors over there by the way but what weve done has never been done if you look at alaska with anwr perhaps the biggest drilling site in the world even ronald reagan and bush and clinton everybody wanted to get it done i got it done anwr in alaska probably or possibly the biggest drilling site in the world now what weve done has been incredible recently it looked like the energy business was going to be a catastrophe we were number one in the world and then we had the pandemic and nobody was using energy nobody was driving in automobiles no gasoline by the way gasoline prices for everyone a very very', ' low in many cases less than thats pretty incredible i saved the energy business i got russia and i got saudi arabia on the phone and they cut way back and were now at and plus a barrel were saving tens of millions of jobs in energy were the number one in energy in the world with all that weve done we made and brought this country to the greatest point in its history we never had an economy like we had prior to the china plague or china virus coming in we never had numbers like it we are going to have them again and everyone knows im going to rebuild it i had to close it up we saved millions of lives by closing it if we didnt close i you would have seen numbers that would have been times what you have right now one death is too much but it would have been to times maybe more than that what you have we closed this greatest economy ever far bigger than china better than china china was having by the way the worst year they had in years tariffs they paid us tens of billions of dollars the worst year theyve had think of it in years we were having the best year weve ever had i had to close it and now were reopening it next year well be stronger itll be the strongest year so far itll be better even than last year okay thank you very much ill be heading back ill see you back at the white house thank you very much were going to take an additional tour of the facility with your great leaders thank you very much to the people of north carolina we love being here ']\n",
            "['good afternoon everyone thank you for joining us i am joined today by superintendent of public instruction kathy hoffman thank you for being here superintendent of course the leader of arizonas department of health services dr cara christ thank you for being here dr christ and the gentleman who leads our national guard and dema effort general mcguire thanks for being here i want to take everybody through the latest information around coronavirus in arizona and then were going to have an education update for you as well i want to begin by just saying thank you once again i want to say thank you to the healthcare workers our doctors our nurses our healthcare professionals everybody thats on the frontline we know how hard youre inaudible and were incredibly grateful for what youre doing in protecting arizonans and protecting their lives and also to the business leaders and to the workforce in arizona this has been a challenging time for everyone weve been having a lot of discussions with business leaders and leaders of employer organizations so we could make the best possible decisions and to all arizonans this is affecting everyone in our state were in this together weve asked you to do a lot and were going to share with you the results of where arizona is today and it wouldnt be happening without your partnership and participation i want to remind everyone as i have over the last several weeks that you are safer at home regardless of the information im going to be able to share today coronavirus is with us today and going forward its highly contagious and its in every part of our state and you really help arizona when you are at home at this point in the pandemic todays numbers are total covid cases this week we have average cases and my heart prayers and thoughts go out to the arizona families who have lost a loved one to the coronavirus all people in arizona have been affected by covid none more so than these families and you are in our thoughts and our actions every day in terms of arizonas trend today our major metrics are headed in the right directions covidlike illness in emergency room has a downward trend covid patient icu and hospital bed use has a downward trend and the percentage of positive tests in arizona has a downward trend lets run through the numbers blue line is covidlike illness in arizona the gold line is influenzalike if you look at the covidlike the blue line you can see the two legs over the last two weeks are a dramatic drop down from to thats in just two weeks that much of a decrease thank you to arizonans for participating in this improvement our covid cases by day if you can see on the chart our cases began to ramp up in june and escalated through july theyre headed in the other direction so for several weeks we had a trend going in the right direction now were seeing some im sorry in the beginning of june we had a trend headed in the wrong direction over the last couple weeks you see the beginnings of a trend in the right direction we need to continue that headed in the right direction in terms of lessening our cases by day and most specifically in terms of lowering our positivity rate in arizona the blue mountain data graph is the number of tests in arizona the gold line is our percentage positivity weve been as high as in this last week a downward trend of its the right direction its still too high but it is headed in the right direction lets look at our hospital bed capacity this does not include the additional surge beds in our preparation for a potential worst case scenario but what you see here is capacity the gold is the covidlike illness or the patients that do have covid inside our hospitals if you look at the course of the last six weeks youll see an increase a flattening and the beginnings of a slight decrease youll see the same thing here with our icu beds it does not include the surge capacity beds that we had but for the patients that have covid youve seen an increase a flattening and the beginning of a slight decrease youll see the same trend here for ventilators around covid our testing by day the blue line is pcr test the orange is serology we are over one million total tests in the state of arizona with many more on the way i want to thank dr crow for the saliva test that asu has innovated and will be bringing to market dr robbins for his leadership on the serology test we do have some issues around demand for our testing we have tests available and we want people to take advantage of that were going to be talking about that a little bit later in the presentation lets talk about the recent actions that weve taken in arizona to slow the spread of this virus weve basically been prohibiting large gatherings i want to thank our mayors and county superintendents we have nearly of our state with local mask ordinances they make a real difference weve paused operations on gyms bars nightclubs water parks and tubing superintendent hoffman and i delayed the first day of school and weve reduced restaurant ca', 'pacity in arizona so lets look at how that has affected our results nearly three plus weeks ago i introduced this number the r number into our discussions this is the number that represents the average number of people who become infected by an infectious person when this number was introduced on june arizona was at meaning for every infected person more than one person was being infected over the last three weeks arizona has moved that number basis points in the right direction our r in arizona today is beneath one and its been beneath one since july so i want to thank you that couldnt happen without the participation of the citizens of arizona people are listening to the safer at home instruction theyre limiting mobility and it is resulting in positive numbers and direction for our state this is the new york times showing daily cases per individuals in the state it tracks hot spots in arizona if you can see from the day trend in many parts of our state and specifically in the most populous parts of our state were seeing a decline but were not seeing a decline everywhere so id ask you to continue to stay vigilant to know no matter whether youre in phoenix tucson or a rural area the virus is contagious and if we dont do the things we should be doing it can begin to more rapidly spread these are the newly reported cases by day in arizona according to the times you can see what a tough june the state of arizona had how it began to flatten with some of the mitigation measures we put forward several weeks ago and now we are seeing a decline in cases and we need to continue to see that now arizonas increase in cases begins in june our country had a flat june their escalation has been in july thats where weve seen our downturn i said last week that for weeks and weeks arizona was on this page every time i looked this is where new cases are increasing in our nation today theres states and territories where new cases are increasing last week for the first time we moved to where new cases are mostly the same and this week for the first week were one of two states in the country whee new cases are decreasing thats where we prefer to stay and thats where some of the actions that people are taking in the mitigation can keep us i hear the folks that dont want to hear from the new york times and dont want to hear what they have to say so if the new york times isnt good enough for you take it from msnbc they also show a decrease for cases in the state of arizona and for folks who dont want to hear from mainstream media outlets take it from the gold standard of excellence in public health internationally johns hopkins university of medicine to my eye arizona is the greenest state in the nation that is a downward trend over the previous three days and weve been there now for the last two times that we visited thats where we would like to stay is with a downward trend this is the covid tracking project i think they do a very good job of simplifying things they also let you go to a graph and whether you want to see it by state region nation or country you can customize it this is arizonas daily case count in red and our hospitalizations in blue you can see very simply that weve hit a peak and weve begun to head in the right direction lets continue that so that we dont have another peak its not unusual after we finish the presentation and turn it over for questions of someone to ask every now and again how do we trust the numbers that arizona is presenting first i want you to know that the covid tracking project gives arizona an a for our data information and thats the arizona department of health services thats azhealthgov so i know arizonans can deal with the truth we just want to make sure that you have the facts at the end of this press conference now lets talk about arizonas new normal and what we see for the foreseeable future we have been in the unhappy but necessary business of breaking up large adult gatherings thats why youve seen the businesses and venues here not operating or not operating in any of the traditional senses with people and fans and congregations and thats where were going to be for some time so today were going to continue to press on with the strategies that are working in arizona and continue them so todays announcements around mitigation are that the closure will be extended for gyms bars nightclubs water parks and tubing now people ask how do we come up with these venues for closure and i want you to know this is the direct recommendation from the centers for disease control so when you say your decisions are going to be guided by public health and not politics or whats popular you listen to public health and the recommendation for these venues is closure thats where we are at this time so theres no victory lap today theres no celebration we cannot let up we need to continue to be vigilant every day in the state of arizona to continue pressing and to make sure that we stay focused on the fundamentals so no victory lap no celebratio', 'n only continued physical distancing washing your hands and remembering that youre safer at home in addition to that one of the things that you can do that will make the biggest difference of course is wearing a mask and i want to thank arizonans from all over the state ive been sent pictures i know the pictures that oftentimes make the media are the ones that are outliers but i know people all over our state and especially in large crowds and when they havent been able to socially distance are more often than not choosing to wear a mask and i want to thank you for doing that we want to make sure that everybody that needs a mask has access to a mask we want to make sure that masks are there for vulnerable arizonans we introduced this last week at the press conference and were proud to partner with hanes to provide free cloth masks to arizonas most vulnerable residents and to prevent the spread of covid weve had over mask orders that have been received and theyre shipping now thank you for the order and thank you for wearing your mask i also have worked very hard with local leaders influencers and decision makers from around the state to make sure masks are seen as a good idea and something youre doing so that we can protect lives in arizona and protect our livelihoods i want to thank the leaders in the advertising industry inaudible high noon off madison urias lt rr and hma public relations we brought them together we challenged them to help us make wearing masks more ubiquitous and prevalent pull the politics out of it and make it part of what we need to do to get the pandemic behind us and we think that theyve done some good work and theres going to be an ad campaign were going to be advocating and resourcing this campaign statewide were grateful for their work and the campaigns going to be called tougher than covid were going to take a look at the couple of the spots now so hopefully this will play through the viewership in the conference in both english and spanish theyre going to be on tvs billboards and social media and once again i want to thank our team of marketing professionals for donating their time and giving us a really excellent effort and were looking forward to getting these on the air and on a billboard close to you theres another billboard as well go ahead tell me my mask looks weak i think theres theres more to follow so i want to switch gears now if we can to public k education something thats very topical and important in arizona i want to thank superintendent of public instruction kathy hoffman for being a partner and a leader and for prioritizing arizona children and safe and successful education in our state i also want to thank representative michelle udall and senator sylvia allen for their effort and input into the plan that were going to present going forward and with that i want to turn it over to superintendent kathy hoffman superintendent kathy hoffman thats why i am proud to join here today to outline additional clarity and guidance around the start of the next school year including developing benchmarks based on public health data that schools will use to determine the start of inperson instruction a dedication to fully fund distance learning flexibility and clarity around onsite learning requirements for vulnerable students continuity of pay for all educators and critical policies that support safety and student learning each of those pieces are extremely complex and have taken time and partnership to work through kathy hoffman while doing what they do best educating our students i have said before that protecting our school communities is a statewide effort i want to thank the members of our congressional delegation who have reached out to offer their advocacy for critical additional funding for schools and any upcoming relief packages i also want to thank the arizonans who have taken this pandemic seriously who have made sacrifices worn masks to protect themselves and their neighbors physically distanced and stayed home whenever possible covid has impacted all of us it has impacted my family my staff and my friends my brother living in italy was one of the first there to contract covid in february when there were still many unknowns and thankfully he made a full recovery my husband a physician in residency at phoenix childrens hospital faces risks in his job every day kathy hoffman chinles high school building is much more than a set of classrooms it is a community gathering space it is a space to build the skills minds and hearts of the next generation this is why i take so seriously the opportunity for schools to safely reopen their facilities it is the reason why i call on arizonans to mask up physically distance and stay home whenever they are able but i want to be clear that teaching and learning will happen no matter what the next school year looks like in your community i am thrilled to join here today to share our guarantees on how we will support schools in providing safe instruction and critical ', 'services during this next academic year thank you thanks very much superintendent so lets run through the plan for the next school year arizona will be open for learning and our priorities are going to be public health and safety were going to make data driven decisions there will be parental choice options for families in different situations flexibility to our school leaders and recognizing that the achievement gap and the digital divide are real and do everything we can to reduce and eliminate it and viewing our schools as our most essential service we provide as we move forward now i also want to thank all the leaders influencers and decision makers superintendents and the superintendent this plan was informed by your input well much of the public discussion has been focused on a date certain the focus needs to be on ensuring that arizona students have a successful academic year the goal is to provide our students with rigorous instruction and consistency in learning while prioritizing their health and safety this is the greatest challenge to public education in our lifetimes and arizona has the opportunity to lead the nation and that superintendent hoffman and my goal to make arizona a model state in this situation providing the best learning experience to kids in the safest environment during this crisis so days of instruction or equivalent hours will be required this year there will be options for inperson and distance learning and there will be teacher led distance learning that must begin by the first date of the academic school year children deserve a safe learning environment this includes kids and especially kids enrolled in free and reduced lunch programs special education students english language learners and foster kids so our schools must provide free onsite learning and support services while implementing healthy and safe protocols in the required onsite learning our decisions will be datadriven with maximum flexibility to local school leaders recognizing they need public health data to make decisions the arizona department of health services will develop and release public health benchmarks for the safe return of inperson teacher led classroom instruction local school leaders will make the determination and consider these recommendations face coverings schools will develop an implement face covering policies all adults will have a face covering on inside a school there will be exceptions for students when they can socially distance outside in playground settings breaks for students to take their masks off in a safe environment and other exceptions outlined by the centers for disease control in terms of resources we will bring in an additional additional investment in k education from the federal cares act in terms of million in grant dollars to schools this will ensure budget stability recognize additional costs inperson learning well bring to districts in the school year and closing the achievement gap this has been pointed out by many leaders in k education how real this was how it was amplified last year i want to thank dr chad gaston of phoenix unified for pointing this out in our last visit million to expand broadband million to bring in support for high need schools six million for the teachers academy a million dollars in micro grants to support innovative programs a million dollars for the school of the deaf and blind for leadership development for tutoring kids from teach for america so if you have questions or you want to see more on this you can go to your schools website for specifics to your superintendents this also be up on the superintendents website along with the governors website with more to follow learning starts now and when you want to see the specifics around now thats where you go to your local website switching gears again around getting tested talking about the coronavirus we know people want to get tested we have prioritized essential workers symptomatic and sick folks today we have tests available this is cdc surge testing these sites have been up and running since friday to date the wait times have been minimal and unfortunately the demand has been low if you look in maryvale our task capacity had of the test thats been administered and in south phoenix its been less so we want more to get tested at the sites its completely free theres no id required centrally located in the valley and youll have the results between and hours if you need more specific information go to azhealthgovsurgetesting and with that i want to turn it over to dr cara christ for a public health update dr christ dr cara christ so to talk about expanding testing a little bit more asu will be expanding their saliva based testing sites these are the free sites that they collect at they will continue to operate out of the west valley we will be adding sites in pima county coconino county and la paz county and then we have been working with additional providers to expand testing or to expand their capacity and that includes embr', 'y womens health cvs pharmacies the federally qualified health centers will be receiving grants to provide testing at their centers were working with a quality health to expand their testing in partnership with clpc as well as banner has expanded the number of tests that they can perform and they do have sites that are available dr cara christ thats the time from the collect to the time that they report get that result obviously since is an average we do know that there are days that are longer were getting a lot of questions about the viability of the samples and how long that they can be stored so they can be refrigerated for several days between three and five days depending on what type of media they are in and how they are collected they can be frozen at your regular freezer temperature so minus degrees for a week if you put them at minus or minus which we refer to as a deep freeze they can be frozen indefinitely and rewarmed and then tested the long turnaround times like i said do impact public health because we want to be able to connect with the people we want to give them the instructions on how to prevent transmitting covid to others and we want to get in touch with their contacts so that we can break that transmission chain dr cara christ so to talk about a couple of the initiatives that we announced the last week on our hospital resources we have implemented the staffing initiative we were able to secure that contract with vizient we have placed a request for staff to be allocated to hospitals in every region of the state we are prioritizing rural hospitals that have high transfer to our metropolitan high acuity hospitals and then were prioritizing our large hospitals that receive a number of those transfers staffing at some of those sites starts this week thank you very much dr christ thank you to your team i know how hard theyve been working at the department of health services and with that i want to turn it over to major general mick mcguire to give us an update on all the good work that dema is doing thanks so much general mcguire and thanks for all the good work that all the people at dema are doing and the brave women and men of the national guard as well they have been helpful at every turn and all of arizona is grateful so our plan of action moving forward is that were going to continue to take a responsible approach the decisions from my office will be guided by public health were going to ramp up the testing to identify infection in arizona you can see the investment around increasing lab capacity and the additional collection sites we want to provide relief to health officials and contact tracing to contain the spread and well measure the efficacy of our mitigation strategies metrics to watch weve had a downward trending cases but we are going to continue to focus on additional testing so with that there may be more cases on a horizon please lets focus on the percent positivity thats a number that we want to drive down were in a position today where we have capacity where people that are curious can get a test and we want to encourage you to get a test and schedule a test you can go to azhealthgov for more information also that mobility and rnaught number is something we want to keep below one if you make good decisions and are responsible stay safer at home thats helpful there and of course we want to make certain as we have the entire time and this is why again i want to say thank you to our doctors and nurses and health care professional and hospital leaders we have had capacity in arizona weve been able to bring capacity to arizona and our commitment is we will maintain capacity in the state of arizona so the next steps are wear a mask wash your hands physically distance and when you can stay home please wear the mask the virus is widespread and remember youre safer at home and with that well open it up for questions patrick peter good afternoon dr christ two weeks ago you were on our air on ktar saying you were looking for positivity rate or less of course to possibly reopen the schools i dont know were away from a date specific target at this point does that number still stand with you would that still be helpful to encourage districts or to show districts that it might be safe to resume in classroom learning peter still not looking for a specific number then i guess is like you said its a mixture of things peter very good and there was a piece of legislation moving through the house that had got approved regarding protecting businesses and other entities from lawsuits related to covid it never made it out of the senate would you consider calling a special session on this topic and perhaps some others related to it theres discussion right now at the federal level around this limiting of liability that may satisfy what the desire of the house and senate were in arizona i want to see where that package comes together before wed make a decision around that next step yeah we want to see what the feds are going to do t', 'heyre going to do something and its going to be likely this next week and then well have a better line of sight as to what might be needed in arizona we provided input from the national governors association on that and i sent a letter to our delegation so i think people can see whats important to me and i think to the state of arizona similarly i wanted to ask about congress has not extended yet the in additional unemployment benefits that a lot of arizonans are depending on and some of the reports weve seen have indicated that they might extend those benefits partially so cut to or are you considering anything at a state level like raising the benefit cap from a week or increasing the earned income disallowance to alleviate that burden on arizonas if that becomes the case so well of course were working with our delegation we sent a letter to our delegation shared widely with congress earlier this week the benefits go through this week we are in right now we know that congress never gets anything done until the last minute so anything thats going to come from the state would come after we have a better idea of whats happening there but where arizona has been able to navigate through this in terms of putting our safety net out making sure no one has fallen through the cracks through a lot of displacement was a partnership with our federal government in doing that well need that to continue to do that i want to see what congress is going to do and theyre going to do something this week i want to say i continue to want a public process a public process wasnt available and the legislature was not in session the decision was basically left to the department of administration decision was basically left to the department of administration can i finish the answer please can i finish the answer okay is it my turn the daughters of the confederacy is the organization that gifted the memorial to the state they wrote a letter to the state and asked for it back so it could be repaired they would like to put it in a separate location not on public property they were the individuals that gifted it to the state they asked for it back we granted their wish no there wasnt a public process available speaker so i wanted to get some more clarification about the schools coming back to sessions you mentioned there was a require onsite learning part of your presentation with the days as well what will that mean exactly with schools that choose to do completely online learning for the semester at least superintendent kathy hoffman some of the clarification that we provide through this new executive order is for example that a district doesnt have to have that at every school it could be one school per district that provides that onsite learning it could also be through a community partner like the boys and girls club has stepped up and said that theyre willing and eager enthusiastic to help serve students as well we wanted to make that really clear that the intent behind that requirement was to make sure that kids who really need it have a safe place to go kathy hoffman do you want me to start it and then kathy hoffman okay ill start in the executive order the department of education will be working with the department of health services and our county health offices to develop this framework by august it could be even sooner but we wanted to give all of us some time to be looking at different benchmarks and data points and come to consensus of that and then the idea is for our local school leaders like school governing boards and superintendents to have a framework to use and to be working in conjunction in close collaboration with their county health departments dr cara christ well be taking a look and reviewing what other states are using as benchmarks as well as making sure that theyre consistent with the centers for disease control and the white house task force we will be bringing that together the teams already started on that speaker billy next so billy i appreciate the question and i remain hopeful and optimistic as well at the same time ive got to deal with the facts that are in front of us i would welcome the challenge of helping educate arizonans as to why this vaccine would make our lives safer and healthier if and when its ready i think we all know what a long shot any vaccine like this is weve got the smartest most innovative medical professionals in the world in our nation but if that is something that we would have available to us thats something that i think youd see a full court press across the board to make certain that the maximum amount of our people were able to have the immunity to this virus kathy hoffman in terms of reporting our schools still have to follow hipaa requirements and things like that so we have been working closely with the department of health services in developing the department of health services has been developing protocols for our school leaders so they know exactly what steps to take when there is a positive case in t', 'he school community whether its a student or a teacher or staff dr cara christ they are working on those protocols there usually does require notification if there is a disease in a classroom that could be spread so well be working on that as part of the guidelines speaker inaudible nicole and then ali inaudible nicole i didnt say that things were positive i said these are the facts these are the data metrics that we have that theres no victory laps that theres no celebration that well continue to be vigilant and part of the reason that i show other independent and sometimes adversarial sources is because of exactly what youre asking right now everything that is put up here is informed by the arizona department of health services which from the covid tracking project has an a for its data i present the facts we are testing we have over a million tests that have been conducted in arizona our cases are going down by our data and by independent sources data our cases are going down now there is a backlog that is also a fact the private labs have been swamped and we are in a bit of a dilemma one is dr christ is going to talk about the efforts and the resources were providing to the private labs so that we get those facts and that they go into the positivity rate and then the other issue that we have is we dont have the demand for the tests we have several weeks where the demand is off the charts and cars are parked around the block today we have two sites that are operating between am and pm theyre wide open you dont need an appointment and no ones going through them so were encouraging people to get a test thats a test where youll get a result much more quickly and if you want to talk about the backlog at sonora quest id be grateful lets answer the question nicole okay well testing has and we would like to see nothing more than our positivity decrease so we are very eager to get those samples run thats accurate nicole like i said theres that demand superintendent im working with the subject matter professionals the experts and across the aisle and ill continue to do it ali good afternoon everyone three questions ones really simple how does any of this affect private or religious schools does any of this affect any of them not directly it indirectly oftentimes or at least in past scenarios theyve looked to state guidelines and guidance to inform their decisions but they have options we are following the public health and the directive or recommendation around a closure directive is much different than limiting in terms of occupancy at least in discussions with the leaders on the task force in washington dc the objective around those numbers is social distancing and you can see some of the issues that weve had here in arizona and some of the other western states including california and texas their climates are different than ours their options for some of their venues are unique to ours our guidance has been so that we can keep the social and physical distancing and like i said weve seen the numbers going in the right direction we continue to monitor it but we have options if we need to change im going to stay with the policy that ive had through this i want to see a public process when the legislature comes back well have the opportunity to put a public process forward no i dont want to kick the can down the road im focused on coronavirus right now this is a question that youve been asking me for well over a year and ive stayed to the same policy that i am not unilaterally going to make decisions on monuments and memorials there should be a public process speaker crosstalk were going to go with angela gonzales from phoenix business journal angela go ahead you might need to unmute yourself there angela we cant hear you speaker yes we can yes ill answer the resource question and let the superintendent as well the idea is that we want to fully fund out schools our teachers and our educators we also know theres been additional funding necessary so were working with cares acts dollars flexible funds and schools that follow the guidelines that we are presenting are going to have access to these funds and i also know at least as i was coming into this press conference i saw discussion around additional funding from congress as well so thats a possibility and if you want to talk about some of the guidelines and dr christ on the public health side of things thank you angela kathy hoffman there could be scenarios in the future where a school could open for inperson instruction and then if there happens to be another outbreak in that area they may need to close again so that is a possibility and that was actually included in part of our roadmap for reopening schools that we outlined different types of recommendations for different scenarios and thats one of the scenarios that we accounted for kathy hoffman our local governing boards have the authority to make that decision i would expect it would be the local governing boards making a decision in conjuncti', 'on with their local county health offices jj cooper thanks were coming up on the end of summer vacation and were just hearing that its going to be another two weeks or so before we get the metrics that schools can use to make these decisions why arent those available now or sooner given that weve known this problem was coming for as long as its been out there and then given the extreme delays in testing and measuring whats going on in the community how confident are you that those metrics will have reliable accurate uptodate data for the school districts to use thanks jj and i think its a fair question theres a framework that already exists things have changed quite a bit in the last four weeks i think weve been able to see that when we first had our meeting with the superintendents after the end of last school year all of the preparations were about going back into school in the traditional setting through the course of the discussions weve really found that weve got a very large constituency that no matter what in this setting and i mean no matter what even back in the beginning they dont feel comfortable or feel safe and likely do not want to go back into schools until theres a vaccine we also have a very large constituency that is ready to go back into school in person tomorrow and not concerned about anything thats in front of us and then we also have a very large constituency that has nowhere else to go except to the school their parent may be one of our frontline healthcare workers inside the hospital and they have to go to work so were trying to enhance the guidance to answer all the questions just like some of the questions that we face today around what if and what happens and what if this scenario happens in a school what if a student what if a teacher what if a classroom what a cohort you can really go down one after another were letting the subject matter experts from public instruction and the department of health services along with the centers for disease control do that what we laid out for you today was that were going to have a safe and successful school year in the state of arizona with flexibility ample resources and there will be hybrid options available arizona has always been a state thats respected parental choice and i want to really hand it not only to our leaders and our superintendents and our teachers but i think as much as i wish we didnt have to deal with what happened in the spring i think our state had a leap frog forward in terms of innovations and teachers that have embraced distance learning and chad guston in our last meeting said phoenix union and where it is right now has set an objective at least for the first quarter or first semester that theyre going to be the best in the world at distance learning i think having a kid in a classroom is a great thing in this situation somebody thats got an underlying health condition or a weakened immunity we would never force them to do something that would be against their safety and we would want to provide options for them do you have anything to add superintendent kathy hoffman so when we put this executive order together it was really important to us to actually go back to the roadmap and think about all the different scenarios that our schools might face in this upcoming year and be prepared for significant amount of time doing distance learning and give those flexibilities and assurances so that our schools are empowered to go for learning to start which is what we want we want them to start connecting with our kids across the state so im back to my optimism that this will be a durable plan that we can use the framework and the public health data rather than setting a date which could change again this is the first that ive heard of that id have to know the details and the facts before i commented patrick patrick thanks kathy hoffman i would say at this point its unlikely that schools will be ready to start their full inperson instruction on august th but we will have the onsite learning opportunities available that soon so that will be where schools are developing plans for their at risk student populations or for serving essential workers children and so there will be continued services starting at that time but in terms of were not setting a statewide date for when school will start were recreating the framework so that our schools can make data informed decisions okay and i also want to say morgan if i can because theres been a couple of questions around the date the date was something that the superintendent and i were using to make announcements about what was happening but school in arizona has never started on a certain date weve had all kinds of flexibility and option from schools that go through the summer that take fall break and this differs really by governing board and by region in the state so the idea around the date is we wanted to pull that off the table and give the guidelines where the things that people love about arizona education the f', 'lexibility the parental choice and the additional resources while allowing the people that know how to get it done and get it done best at the local level to have those flexibilities do you want to talk about that from a public health perspective and the situation that children are in versus are vulnerable please patrick and then just really just one final thing we are changing the way kids are going to be learning at somerton and hoffman are you concerned that our state of children arent going to get the education this year that they would have gotten a year ago kathy hoffman so i want to acknowledge that our educators are going above and beyond to design completely a complete new system of online and distance learning and theyre doing everything they can to connect with kids and families whether thats calling them or online conference the video conferencing and doing everything they can to connect with their families but its never going to be the same as having all kids coming into a classroom and having all the opportunities that our schools provide and we know theres differences in family resources so some of our families dont have internet dont have computer skills dont maybe have parents that dont speak english theres just completely different types of home situations that i am very concerned about morgan i would add to the question am i concerned about our kids and the education theyre going to receive this year of course thats why were working so hard im putting a plan as the superintendent said that is durable regardless of what is in front of us so that we can maximize our childrens education make it as successful and safe as possible i am confident that our kids did not get that experience last year i think our teachers did everything they possibly could getting thrown the curve ball that came their way but our kids have some makeup to do through no fault of their own likely around math and reading and other things and the other question was am i concerned about a spike in the future and of course thats why we begin every day with the numbers we close every day with the numbers were being so vigilant around this i think the challenges that we have in arizona arent all that much different than pretty much any other state in the country and this is where it really is on leaders and local leaders and teachers and parents and superintendents to be innovative and creative and flexible in figuring this out and thats how the plan was written to not only provide the best that we could put together but to allow others to add to that plan to make it better and then to share those best practices across the state and across the country speaker were going to keep going were going to go to inaudible next were going to go to ben giles from kjzz ben go ahead dr cara christ yes so that will be part of that theyll work with their local county health departments so county health departments are always working with their schools in influenza season when there are outbreaks of disease there will be guidelines around that ben giles yes you also talked about a discouraging statistic that it seems the demand for testing has gone down even as youve worked with state officials and other private organizations to expand testing opportunities i want to open this question to dr christ as well what do you attribute to the lower demand and how maybe can you inspire confidence in arizonans to go out there and get tested well id be speculating but i think it could be a number of things one testing has been a huge challenge in arizona the testing in terms of supply chain and national resources was really going to many other places because the other places were the hot spots for so long arizona was really not in harms way writ large the way the eastern seaboard was for march and april and may and june as we began to have our increase in cases and increase in testing a lot of our wait times went longer and weve worked very hard to make it more convenient for people to get a test and then in addition sometimes the return has been too long so we think that weve addressed each of those in their turn they remain a challenge and i think oftentimes when cases are spiking and it may be more topical in the news theres more demand from people that dont feel sick or symptomatic and weve had a couple of weeks of improving numbers and its taken away some of that demand and we want to find a way that we can get more people tested people that are feeling sick or symptomatic or in a vulnerable situation or a frontline worker were going to prioritize tests for them but we want the curious now to also be tested its one way that we think well be able to further open our economy make better decisions about things that you get involved in and were also quite certain that it will lower our positivity score as well dr christ thank you josh and dr christ with respect to the present positive number the seven day average for the state is around a day average thats leading the nation that numb', 'er problematic for experts because again it shows that theres widespread community being impacted by the virus wouldnt that number alone cause you pause and have you press the brake on reopening businesses in general and possibly even shutting down the state again well we look at the number over the course of time like i said we have been prioritizing people that are sick symptomatic and working in these settings were confident yesterdays test the previous weeks test what weve seen in terms of the trend that were making responsible incremental decisions and we have shut some things down that have been the cdcs recommendation of course we dont want to do that we felt that that was necessary in which to do that and then the fact that we can expand testing logically you should see a decrease in terms of positivity and much of what were talking about is still several weeks out so oftentimes we have folks come in and say why arent you letting us know further in advance i mean this has been a dynamic and fluid situation its changed itll continue to change do you have anything more dr cara christ so we are looking at the percent positivity like i said we are looking at it from the previous weeks so as the percent positivity is reported you want it reported against the timeframe that it was actually taken not the time that its reported to the health department and so that may be one of the difference between the seven day moving average as well as like what you see on our website so we are monitoring that that is a very important factor and one of the reasons that we made the recommendation not to reopen the bars and not to reopen some of those businesses that had closed down that was also the recommendation for why we wanted to have the benchmarks so that schools could feel comfortable were not recommending that they open next week we know that we will have the data that should be on the backlog should be cleared by the st so we should have all available data well be able to use that as we develop the benchmarks and our local health departments and our local schools can make that decision dr cara christ so are you asking about what guidelines we would put in place to prevent the spread in im sorry dr cara christ okay we have recommendations on our website if you go to azhealthgov its a lot of those same type of recommendations so making sure that people can physically distance that theyre wearing masks when it is safe to do so that they are encouraging people to stay home when theyre sick and they have flexible leave policies so that people can do that dr cara christ we would recommend that they have flexible workplace or leave policy speaker we got to keep moving josh dr cara christ just like any other business were not immune to covid dr cara christ we have had cases of covid lorraine rivera hi thanks for taking my question i have two one of them for dr christ are children at any increased risk of their immune systems perhaps losing some of their ability to fight illnesses given that they havent been around each other since march and then the other question is for it may be for general mcguire but it looks like some of the communities with native american communities are still struggling if you could give us some understanding as to why they continue to be challenged given all the resources that have been directed to those areas speaker immune systems general mcguire on the tribal nations speaker thank you lorraine i know theres more questions but we really have to get going speaker one question inaudible it is well first i want to say youre right if we dont have a better turnaround time thats why weve provided resources to our private providers we need faster turnaround time if you go to the two sites that are available right now you do get a faster turnaround and thats the best and only way for contact tracing to be effective and thats of course what we want were going to be talking a lot more and have higher expectations around testing tracing and when someone is positive we want to of course see the isolation as well i want to say first thank you very much to superintendent of public instruction kathy hoffman we have high hopes and expectations for our families our kids our teachers for this upcoming school year its going to be an ongoing challenge and we have put our heads together to put a plan out there that is durable that is flexible and that has resources and we will continue to bring forth information and data along the way so that we can have the safest and most successful school year to do that the things that weve done so far so that we could slow the spread bring our case count and our positivity heading in the right direction with more to do because i come in here and im able to report improving numbers is not cause for a celebration its a cause for evidence that some of the decisions and habits and rigor and discipline that arizonans are showing is working and im asking you to please continue doing that the idea of wearing a mask ']\n",
            "['no thats not on good afternoon a couple of months back in fact on june st we announced with some urgency our concerns about what was happening in imperial county california the county had experienced a significant rise in number of transmissions related to covid concern was made more paramount as it relates to the overwhelming situation for the hospital system not only in the icus but the ability to provide for emergency care more broadly diversion rates for ambulances health care personnel questions a lot of stress that was placed because of this pandemic on the county on june st we committed to a new process a new protocol to help support the county in their efforts began the process of decompressing their hospital system over patients were moved out of imperial county hospitals into surrounding and neighboring communities and in some instances we even brought patients here into northern california we approached our strategy in the county more as a strike team more as a unified command approach something you would see more traditionally as it relates to how we organize and construct our approach to dealing with other emergencies like wildfires and the like that process took shape again in the beginning of june at a time when we had transmission rates positivity rates north of in imperial county in fact it peaked at you could see on this graph the number of cases reflected in imperial county in the blue line substantially outpacing the number of cases in the rest of the state this graph certainly presents itself as a spike in cases in imperial county that required a new approach new strategies and new accountability structures and thats exactly what took place the model now as were referring to it the imperial model was all about providing supports building capacity at the local level filling in gaps meeting needs both on personal protective gear not just personnel meeting the needs of the hospital system providing additional supports new strategies and prevention from psa campaigns culturally competent messages that were delivered to individuals as well as businesses and more broadly the community at large in addition to sectoral closures that we made abundantly clear as it relates to moving forward to address the concerns that were flaring up in certain sectors of the economy in the valley you can see on this slide the number of cases as they began to spike we began to intervene you can see the medical personnel that we began to send in around june rd where we worked with not only state and county and local officials but broadened that support by getting a lot of federal supports as well from a number of federal agencies you can see after those interventions were put into place again beginning with the decompressing of the hospital system as a foundational principle more targeted supports and some additional sectoral changes as it relates to returning to a stay at home order you could see that line spiked and substantially began its decline yesterdays positivity rate still high but at a successful approach one that requires constant vigilance one that were continuing to engage in but one that long windedly is now become a model in terms of our approach the imperial approach in other parts of the state last week where we last joined each other i began the process of announcing strategies in the central valley in eight counties in the central valley for the obvious reason that you could see exampled here on this chart were starting to see not only an increase in the positivity rates i mentioned last week where i made some announcements about our interventions in central valley that we saw positivity rates on the lower end in fresno at the time at and peaking around tulare at a rate not where we were in imperial but we dont want to see it go to where imperial went and thats why we felt it was appropriate to intervene using the information using the experience the best practice the data collection the approach in imperial', ' and beginning that approach in the central valley why the central valley well again this slide underscores the concerns youre starting to see the hospitalization and icu rates increase not just positivity rates in the valley outpacing the rest of california and if you asked me today what our biggest area of concern in a state as large as ours it is indeed the central valley were seeing stabilization in other parts of the state youll see some declines in a moment when i make presentation including some stabilization and some modest declines in southern california the central valley again reinforced by this slide reinforced by our presentation in stockton last week in our announcement last week is indeed the area of our most important targeted interventions we are again doing everything we can to fill in local gaps and working with counties to assess their current dashboard as it relates to data collection identifying whatever gaps may exist or persist in their respective communities but more importantly than anything else identifying partners not just partners from governmental agencies again federal agencies five out of the eight department of defense medical teams are deployed now in the central valley again federal partnerships but also developing private partnerships critical to develop partnerships with employers critical to develop partnerships with nongovernmental organizations nonprofits ngos to again build capacity and build our collective response with a unified command approach to addressing the concerns in the valley and so thats exactly what we highlighted last week we built that partnership to include million dollars of new resources for disease investigation for contact tracing and for our isolation and quarantine efforts in addition to that we have been able to and i want to thank the sierra health foundation in particular they have been able to organize a collective effort million of additional dollars resources that philanthropy has brought to the table to supplement or increase rather the million dollar contribution that we announced last week and this is for rent supplies really helping individuals with utility bills and the like and focusing individuals utility bills and the like and focusing on the most vulnerable and the most vulnerable families and remember this is and dr galley has made this abundantly clear in a number of his presentations weve made it abundantly clear over the course of the last number of months as well disproportionately this disease is impacting our diverse communities disproportionately impacting the latino community disproportionately impacting the community in the central valley and so when we talk about the central valley i hope we can really paint a picture in terms of our consciousness of how impactful this has been on the latinx community and thats why our targeted interventions disproportionately are focusing on essential workforce on farm workers on critical workforce and hospitality retail sector and the like that is being impacted by this disease and so i wanted to begin today as we left off last week reinforcing the merits of the approach we took in imperial county recognizing again good enough never is recognizing as i do as we do that the effort is ongoing theres a constancy to our focus theres not just a passing interest in these efforts theyre not episodic theres a full blown commitment to follow through to bend this curve to suppress the growth and ultimately extinguish this virus which is indeed our long term goal or at least mitigate its impacts through therapeutics and vaccination as it relates to the efforts statewide to do the same i want to give you some good news and that is our number of positive cases yesterday was that is a one day number and again ive made this point abundant over the past and that is i dont look to one day numbers they go up they go down theres some weekend reporting often that is example on mondays thats why the seven day average', ' becomes even more important and that seven day average youll see its that seven day average by the way is down roughly from the previous seven day average thats good news decline the last time you saw a slide like this the numbers was north of daily average cases to be exact so from cases seven day average from a week ago now down decline from our previous reporting period again thats case numbers and i caution folks look ive said this in the past others have said this some for different purposes than the purpose which we reinforce this as we increase our tests youre going to see an increase in case numbers i caution people not to focus as much on that but to look at positivity rates and look at hospital rates and icu rates in the state of california theyve become more profoundly significant from the perspective of mortality from the perspective of our healthcare delivery system and our capacity we want to test as many people as we can but the purpose of the test is not just to show a number its an effort to have a sense of where the community is spread is how we can mitigate that spread how we can help support our contact tracers isolate quarantine people and ultimately mitigate the impact to our hospital system and into our icus and so thats why the positivity rate this number youve watched these presentations youre very familiar with this slide this positivity rate is so important here is extending on the narrative of some early good signs decline in the seven day average total number of positive cases but the positivity rate is also seeing a decline as weve increased our daily average tests and you can see the number almost daily average test about just shy of tests yesterday a little bit more than that the day prior we actually reached tests a few days ago but our average daily tests continue to go up the good news is the total number of people testing positive is now going down we have gone down to this reflected in this slide over a day period shows that number that we presented to you on multiple occasions now again tracking down to this is the day number i often provide you the seven day positivity rate the last time i was with you we made a presentation formally with you where i shared slides which was on the th of july not the presentation in stockton last week the seven day positivity rate was got to about at its peak the seven day positivity rate is lower now than the days its down to so day positivity rate reflected in the slide the seven day positivity rate now down to its not where it needs to be and is still too high but again it is good to see this number trending down not trending up not surprisingly as we see positivity rate begin to trend down increased number of people being tested percentage of people being tested relative to the numbers being tested lower we are now not surprisingly seeing hospitalizations go down modestly decrease in the total number of positive cases in our hospitals over a day period decrease the last time i shared slides with you we had seen a increase remember it was much as a few weeks back over a day period so growth now were seeing decline last slide set we shared with you over a week ago showed a increase so again a decline in total hospitalizations not surprisingly youll see the healthcare system capacity with total number of patients declining its just shy of of our total capacity its holding relatively steady not increasing as youve seen in some previous slides hospitalizations go down we encourage to see icu admissions also trending down last slide deck we provided increase in icu admissions youll see reflected in this slide decrease in icu admissions so again these are statewide numbers it does not reflect the reality in the central valley doesnt necessarily reflect the reality where you are living in a particular county a particular part of the state but the overall trend both again positivity rates hospitalizations now icu is showing a decrease from where we were ', 'over a week ago encouraging signs but one week does not make a kind of trend that gives us confidence to generate headlines we are looking forward to that and well need to see another few weeks of this kind of data to come in to feel more confident about where we are as a state the good news is we do feel confident in our critical care capacity the icu numbers declining the total number of icu patients reflected here in this graph to our capacity dropped modestly from to hospitalizations about but did not decline still within a percentage point here we were able to see modest decline over the last reporting period when we presented the slide deck counties are now on our monitoring list youll recall counties when we announced that santa clara county was added to our list when we were in stockton last week now counties this includes san mateo county on low list counties in the state of california though again these counties represent the vast majority of the population in the state and this county monitoring this is profoundly important to all of you that live in those counties as it relates to the sectorial guidelines we put out more restrictive in these counties than in other counties and certainly more restrictive as it relates to reopening our schools goal ultimately is to get off this list for two weeks and that gives us some confidence based on cdc guidelines our own experience here in the state of california to consider making modifications and certainly along the guidelines that we put out as it relates to our public education system and private school system as well that day period is foundational in terms of any subsequent modifications to distance learning which is foundationally required in these counties ill conclude as always to encourage people if you are living with an individual whos tested positive for covid its incredibly important because of mixed families multigenerational families were seeing a lot of spread now in peoples backyards their front yards as well is in their living rooms and thats why we thought important to reinforce remind people of the importance if you are living with someone whos tested positive or has come into contact with someone whos tested positive please stay at home dont share items do the kind of disinfecting that is foundational in terms of mitigating the spread of this disease well continue to highlight this area of focus as it continues to be one of the more challenging in vaccine areas in terms of mitigating the spread of the coronavirus accordingly we remind you as always the most important nonpharmaceutical intervention you can make is wearing these masks again doing everything in your power to physically distance yourself from people that are not part of that cohort and your household continue to wash your hands more broadly and minimize mixing i just want to reinforce this it needs to be reinforced even more minimize mixing to the extent possible again that mixing could occur in your brain backyard your front yard but also again in your living room when you bring people outside your immediate household overextended family members or just generationally you are connecting with loved ones and mixing in a way that can increase the likelihood of the spread of the virus and so thats the update for the day i want to just make one final point reference and its an important and that is total number of deaths in this state has increased over the course of the last few weeks this again for us is a point of obvious concern and for the family members each and every life lost is devastating and our heart goes out including a young person in fresno that lost their lives a teenager and this is a sober reminder of how deadly this disease is and how it can impact anybody and while its absolutely true and i dont want to be an alarmist its absolutely true that number of people that contact this disease that are in their late teens even early teens the likelihood of deaths is very very lo', 'w the reality is we tragically lost a teenager to this virus and its just sober reminder of how powerful and impactful and deadly this disease remains to be and how important it is to do the kind of work we all must do as a society as a community and as individuals to do what we can to mitigate that spread to wear those masks to physically distance to avoid the kind of mixing large crowds and outside your immediate household as much as you possibly can additional lives were lost in our last reporting period yesterday but i want to just caution you is a lower number than youve seen in the past the average numbers now well north of and with the increase weve experienced over the last few weeks the lagging number lagging indicator always in term of the deaths this number is reflected as a lagging indicator meaning were likely to see those numbers remain stubbornly high over the course of the next number of days potentially next week or so were going to monitor that closely well talk openly and honestly as much as we can about it i dont want you to be misled into feeling some more confidence about that numbers again look at those seven and day averages not just one day over another day lives on average weve lost a day as an example just over the day period as it relates to the deaths associated with covid so thats an update on where we are i again want to remind everybody of the importance of targeting our focus and continuing to build capacity and build partnerships we continue to do that county by county health director by health director and business by business and i will be remiss ill just close on this i want to thank the business community weve been out alcohol beverage control community weve been out alcohol beverage control and been out in bars and restaurants and thousands of inperson visits osha has been out in tens of thousands of visits i just want to mark this as a point of consideration and thought the vast majority of businesses are doing everything in their power doing their best under these very difficult circumstances and the vast majority that are not in compliance come into compliance very very quickly i want to just acknowledge that and recognize that perfect rarely is on the menu people are doing their best under extraordinary circumstances both as individuals as customers as employers their employees its exampled in all the outreach thats been done and the incredible compliance that weve seen we havent seen it everywhere and we are putting out citations obviously this is being advanced at the local level as well substantially from an enforcement frame including enforcing on mask mandates as well local government taking the lead in that space and amplifying some of the efforts that are happening at the state level but i do want to acknowledge how the business sector is doing and under incredible circumstances how grateful we are to all of you that are represented in that respect and to all of the employees and customers that are doing their best as well under very trying and difficult circumstances with that of course were happy to answer any questions katie orr hi thank you for taking my question as schools get ready to reopen distance learning at the vast majority of them there are some districts that are requiring teachers to actually go into their classroom and teach their distance learning from those schools that has some teachers upset they cite safety concerns also childcare issues what is your take on that do you think teachers should be required to go to schools to teach no i think that has to be done first of all we give a lot of discretion to local what we call leas these are local education agencies authorities local capacity to make those decisions but based upon bargaining based upon working with labor and making those decisions in a collaborative frame i dont believe anyone should be forced to put their life and health at risk period full stop if people feel their lives are being put at ', 'risk and their health is being put at risk it is incumbent upon us to call that out we have been working very closely with organized labor we are very grateful for their support and guidance of a lot of the information that we put out and the formal guidelines that weve put out and the announcement we made a few weeks ago as it relates to the upcoming school year its been done in the spirit of collaboration and cooperation and i expect and really demand respectfully that that spirit of collaboration and cooperation manifests at the local level and people not be put into harms way as caregivers as teachers as support staff from janitors to bus drivers as secretaries to maintenance workers as well obviously as our children yomara lopez hello some legislators are presenting different bills at the capitol right now that have to do with protecting the tenants who havent been able to pay rent because of the pandemic assembly member chiu with coauthor senator inaudible presented a bill that will provide rental and mortgage relief are you going to support this bill or what bills are you going to support to help those who for a fifth month in a row wont be able to pay rent thank you yeah thank you thank you for the important question as you know the judicial council has an order that currently expires on august th you may be very familiar others are certainly familiar with the executive orders that ive put out going back many many months and the support we provide the clarification the guidance we put out to encourage local government to make decisions as it relates to evictions and the like themselves this is specific to your question we are actively engaged with legislative leadership actively engaged on a number of these specific bills and we are working have been for a number of weeks my team and representative staffs in the legislature to see where we can find common ground to move forward with the kind of acuity and focus and determination thats required at the moment we deeply recognize peoples anxiety we deeply recognize whats at stake as a consequence the spirit of collaboration i assure you is alive and well with not only the authors that you referenced but their respective leadership that demonstrably is committed and focused to this so we are engaged the legislatures back in session and we are working in real time were working against that clock that august th clock as it relates to the judicial councils decision to put this back in the hands of the legislature and the executive branch well be up to that task adam beam you had said that there would be a process for elementary schools to apply for a waiver so that they can have classroom instruction even if they are in a county on the states monitoring list but theres still no process and some schools that are interested in applying say that time is running out so when will the details of this waiver process be revealed this afternoon and weve been working very closely with many of those same officials that had expressed concern we have been engaged in a very collaborative process over the last week in particular there were some modifications that were made last week based upon the input from many in the educational field not just our health field as well so this afternoon jim rupe thank you very much good afternoon a question for dr ghaly too but first of all for you we hear that contact tracing is very very important in helping to slow or stop the spread but yet we dont hear much about contact tracing here in the states so could you update us on what is happening with that process of contact tracing no i appreciate the questions dr ghaly will be up here in just a moment let me just say a number of things and weve made number of presentations over the course of the last number of months as it relates to our partnership with ucsf our partnership with ucla to train a cohort of contact tracers we announced a few weeks back that we have trained over meeting our phase goal', 's of contact tracers we made additional modifications to our approach and the protocols relating to contact tracing based upon the increase in the total number of positive cases statewide that required a modification of some of our original strategies related to contact tracing including by the way making available contact tracers this is fundamental in terms of keeping our children and teachers safe in the upcoming school years when we do reopen for inperson learning which is foundational and is ultimately our goal and our commitment if we can mitigate the spread and see a decline in the spread of this disease but to make available to the school districts in partnership with local health officials these same contact tracers we have a new database system weve been very fortunate to have the optingin of the vast majority of counties into the statewide database system its a system that is also being utilized and deployed in some other states including massachusetts and that provides the ability in real time to share information in this space with that let me ask dr ghaly to provide you a little bit more information about the contact tracing talk a little bit about vitamin d and talk about when indeed someone who may have been exposed what is that gestation period for determining if indeed they have tested positive or indeed are a carrier even asymptomatic carrier of covid dr ghaly dr ghaly so we continue to build up that workforce in anticipation that as we continue to do the things we know reduce our case counts we build up that workforce so that we match them and we can begin to identify all new cases and support those so that they dont become big outbreaks as we try to reduce transmission dr ghaly so the first thing to say is if you are at all symptomatic with covidlike symptoms we encourage you to get tested immediately reach out to a provider if you have one go to the covidcagov website go to our testing page and sign up for a test there we think that should happen immediately if you are a close contact that means somebody who spent or more minutes six or so feet closer to somebody whos known covidpositive lets say in an indoor gathering where youre not unfortunately using a mask we know that the masks protect quite a bit in reducing transmission if youre experiencing symptoms you should go immediately and get tested if youre not and youre a close contact waiting about two days roughly after that contact i think is probably the best time to go get tested dr ghaly as it relates to vitamin d and other things to enhance your immune system as a physician we always want people to practice good healthy behaviors make sure that you get your rest that you eat well that if your doctor or somebody has recommended vitamins that you take those in order that we make sure that everyone is as wellpositioned and suited to fight off not just covid but anything else that might be mixing around the community thank you dr ghaly next question david baker yes i wanted to ask now that we are seeing some progress in the positivity rates and the hospitalizations what do you think is making the difference here is it enforcement actions at the local and the state level as you were talking about is it people taking mask mandates more seriously or the advice not to gather more seriously what is helping us out here yeah i think you answered your own question and i say that with deep respect because i think its a good question an important question i think it is all of the above and growing recognition in a state where we flattened the curve we never experienced the spikes other parts of the country experienced in our own capacity to manifest meaning our own individual capacity to make better decisions to physically distance to wash our hands to avoid mixing as well as the modifications lets be candid these sectoral modifications that have been very very difficult and very trying for small businesses in particular that have just beared a huge brunt', ' of the that have just beared a huge brunt of the impact all of these things in total have made the impact at least as it relates to what were experiencing recently that said these are just a few days five out of six days weve seen a decline in icus weve seen some stabilization in most parts of the state though not in every part of the state central valley being the obvious area of concern and hospitalizations is encouraging at the same time we can quickly find ourselves back to where we were just a few weeks ago a month ago with significant increases if we do not maintain our vigilance if we do not maintain our focus and our commitment again this virus is not going away its not just going to take labor day weekend off its not going to take halloween off or the holidays off until we have quality of therapeutics until we have a vaccine we are going to be living with this virus and i think if theres any lesson that weve learned from the california experience while it is true the positivity rates in this state have never manifested as they have in other parts of this country the reality is our first effort we made tremendous progress because million strong really met that moment and did everything in their power to mitigate the growth and spread of this virus as we began to modify our stay at home orders people began to mix as people began to put down well some cases put down their mask literally not just figuratively we started to see that case rate grow we started to see the background rates begin to grow the community spread begin to grow and so we had to tighten that back up so let us not make that well lets not relive that experience again as we work again our way through the first wave of this pandemic we anticipate the second wave in the fall and that second wave also challenged by what dr ghaly just said as it relates to flu season on top of covid likely having a resurgence in that second wave around the same time and the impact that can have and the stress that can have on our system and so all of this is just a reminder of the vigilance that is required at the moment speaker thank you several states from hawaii to new york states with lower case rates have implemented orders to require visitors to quarantine for two weeks why has california not done that can the state really get a handle on this and keep it if youre not quarantining people that are coming in from hotspots well i think the numbers we presented today prove that we can get a handle on it the numbers that we experienced the ability over the course of the pandemic going back many many months we never did a statewide moratorium on people coming into the state and yet we were able to mitigate the growth of the spread early on and youre now seeing this modest decline that weve exampled here today so to the extent and again ive been very honest about this open about it in previous questions and i appreciate yours we will consider that if we feel its necessary critical and important but at the moment based upon the progress we have made we feel we cant get our arms around this in a judicious way again the key is when you do come in to the state that you abide by all the rules and regulations that our health officers have put forth the rules and regulations that many of you are very familiar with and that is incumbent upon all of us to exercise that kind of vigilance and promote an educational environment and thats what youre seeing with our psa campaign increased efforts around raising awareness so everybody is made more familiar with the rules and regulations and practices accordingly roz plater yes thank you what do you tell the businesses that have said to us they feel like theyre in a bad ping pong match santa clara county for example they opened up and two days later they shut down san mateo county they opened up two weeks later they had to shut back down they hire people they got to lay people off theyre not certain some of them that they can survive ', 'what do you say to those people and is there any kind of help available to them yeah well weve provided an account we have in the state of california we put up tens of millions of dollars for small businesses that otherwise would fall through the cracks on the ppp program as well as sba programs that many small businesses avail themselves to many others are simply unable to access those resources and the state through our ibank has created a micro loan program that we want to not only socialize and make more visible but make available for those that are working through this incredibly challenging time and youre absolutely right look i know a thing or two about small business its been a point of pride point of privilege in my life to have started many many small businesses i deeply and i can assure you deeply appreciate the stress that many of these small business men and women are going through families that are literally on the line and the impact its having in terms of their dreams and their future and their health and i can only express deep empathy as well as gratitude and a resolve for all of us to do what we can to mitigate the spread of this disease the sooner we do that we can get our kids back to school the sooner we do that we can get back to some semblance of modified normalcy as it relates to being able to open up our businesses with some expectation that they can remain open so they dont have to go through this whipsaw back and forth back and forth and so deep respect deep empathy and let me just in terms of being a little bit more prescriptive offer this covidcagov covidcagov is our resource site and if you are one of those business representatives that has just been exampled please go to that site avail yourself to the resources on that site learn about what we are making available in our state through our ibank what gobiz which is our business wing of our state gobiz what they avail in terms of supports to help mitigate your stress and anxiety there are all kinds theres a suite of resources beyond just the direct business loans that the state has theres also a lot of local resources on top of that clearly in addition to the federal resources were trying to supplement that through philanthropy and so we want to make sure that you at least take a look at that site try to get in touch with some of our key personnel and we can see what we can do to address your unique because every business is unique unique circumstance jeremy white hi as im sure youve seen various interest groups labor healthcare and environmental groups are pushing for a tax on the highest earners the california teachers association among them saying they need more revenue to be able to get back to school safely i am curious to know if you would be willing to entertain an increase in taxes on californias top earners including potentially in a special session yeah right now as ive said around special sessions if its necessary to have a special session you referenced a special session in terms of revenue theres been other requests of consideration for special session related to health and other needs well consider a special session for a suite of considerations if that becomes necessary as it relates to the broader issue there are many different proposals many that may be coming to my desk many that are being negotiated in the legislature many that may end up on the ballot as jeremy you become familiar with me and perhaps every recent i dont want to necessarily opine on the process in the legislature with hundreds of bills still pending consideration reconsideration and are currently being debated discussed and negotiated not only among the two houses but also with the administration i dont want to get into those details but as it relates to revenue well have ample opportunity this november to consider a number of things that likely will end up on the november ballot in addition to a number of legislative proposals not least of which the one ', 'that you just referenced elex michaelson thank you im wondering in terms of congratulations on the progress that you announced i know you said weve got a long ways to go but is there a specific measurable that youre looking at to achieve in order to maybe get rid of some of the restrictions weve seen and more broadly bigger picture question californias been dealing with this in a vacuum im wondering what are the key lessons youve learned from governors of other states that have done this well and other states that maybe havent done it as well were constantly engaged and were really blessed to have a very robust national governors association and bipartisanship that has been manifest hogan the current chair soon to be the exchair a new chair will be coming in this month a republican from maryland whos just been an outstanding partner to governors all across the state making that organization available sharing best practices in real time providing resources to really drill down on the merit of your question looking at procurement strategies looking at testing protocols looking at contact tracing and the like and so across the spectrum weve been able to resource one another pick the brains of our respective colleagues as well as connect as we have more formally as you recall with our western states approach where they have the ability now in real time we have the ability in real time through that partnership to engage our chiefs of staff have consistent i think its a weekly now calls where theyre comparing and contrasting best practices discussing things that theyre considering their respective governors and administrations are considering in terms of announcements or approaches and really getting feedback in real time its turned out to be an extraordinarily robust partnership and turned out partnership is working in ways that perhaps people did not anticipate in the beginning and so its just an example to give you a sense of the kind of work that were doing in the spirit of collaboration and sharing of best practices and practices frankly that all of us want to push to the dustbin that said the broader issue around what were looking for is a consistent decline or consistent stabilization now i caution we had consistent stabilization in our icus in hospitalizations and positivity rates in the state early on in this pandemic and so its not just stabilizations were looking for is we want to see some marked decline stabilization and a commensurate effort which is critical of education about any modification subsequent modifications to our guidance and stay at home orders and sectoral strategies what i think is the most important thing that ive reflected on the last number of months ive made this comment in the past is that when we began to modify our state home orders we were focused as understandably we needed to be with industry and employers and we needed to be equally focused in educating the public about what these modifications were and were not and so a big and focused education campaign around mitigating the spread of this virus and transmission of this virus after weve seen a decline stabilization is foundational in terms of any subsequent efforts to reopen and so thats were looking forward to and based on this last week we believe we will once again experience that stabilization as long as people continue to practice the physical distancing that theyre so familiar with wear a mask do what you can on sanitation avoid or at least minimize as much mixing as you possibly can i appreciate everybodys good work i thank them for the well everything we presented here today is because of you and your commitment your resolve and your hard work and so i just want to extend appreciation for your patience your perseverance and your faith and devotion to this cause of mitigating this disease ending this pandemic here in the state look forward to catching back up sharing some updated information in the next day or two thank you ever']\n",
            "['thanks a lot for being here i cant tell whether youre smiling or not but thanks for being here i want to take a few minutes to tell you a little bit about what i think we should be doing right now and then be happy to take questions for weeks weve been seeing the warning signs numbers dont lie infection rates are now going up in more states than there are going down more than people in the united states have lost their lives and those numbers and new infections continue to grow at alarming rate and once again is confronting the simple fact that we wont be able to solve the economic crisis without a rigorous public health approach theyre not separable despite the administrations propaganda that their response should be a cause for celebration despite president trumps requests that we should slow down testing because he thinks it makes him look bad the covid is still here and the daily threat to american health and prosperity is continuing it didnt have to be this way month after month as other leaders in other countries took the necessary steps to get the virus under control failed us month after month as many of us urged him to step up and do his job he failed us just look at the record in january i along with others sounded the alarm of the coronavirus outbreak told the country that covid is quote totally under control and then everything will quote work out well in february i warned about the failure to get information that we needed from the chinese government what i said was the president should demand xi produce the evidence demand it said quote were in great shape reported chinas president said it was quote doing very well in march i set forth a detailed plan for federally funded testing sites across the country as well as guaranteed emergency paid leave later that month i called for a full and immediate use of the defense production act critical critical for delivering supplies that were basically needed accused healthcare workers how did he respond he accused health workers of stealing your masks thats what he said healthcare workers are stealing the masks thats why we dont have them in april i released a plan to secure the supply chain for personal protective equipment surge nationwide testing through a pandemic testing board and launch a nationwide health corp to focus on contact tracing trumps suggestions americans should inject disinfectants into their bodies in may i condemned the false choice between preserving public health and our economy i urged the administration to focus on the basic public health measures like testing that would enable us to sustain our economic recovery trumps response he pushed for reopening without regard to safety and called testing quote frankly overrated this month i outlined a path to reopen our country safely and sustainably it provided workers small businesses schools state local governments the tools resources and guidance that they would need trumps proposal he set a cutoff date for federal funding of testing sites in several states and actually went to court to take away healthcare for million people by trying to get rid of obamacare and now is in retreat remember back in march when i called and he called we talked about the need to act like we were at war with the virus he called himself a war time president remember when he exhorted the nation to sa', 'crifice together and quote in the face of this inevitable and invisible enemy what happened now its almost july and it seems like our war time president has surrendered waived the white flag and left the battlefield today were facing a serious threat and we have to meet it we have to meet it as one country but the president gives no direction and he pits us against one another we cant continue like this half recovery and half getting worse we cant continue half wearing masks and half rejecting science we cant continue half with a plan and half just hoping for the best we wont defeat this virus with a piecemeal approach lifting restrictions prematurely increasing the volatility of the crisis raising the likelihood of needing to reimpose restrictions until our science catches up to reality until we have better treatment for those who become infected and ultimately are safe proven widely available vaccines we have to continue to do all we can as the people in the government to keep our fellow americans safe and healthy today im releasing a plan with the steps i believe should undertake immediately to build on the roadmap i released back in march that would have saved lives if it had been adopted its a plan to save lives in the months ahead once again i encourage him to adopt this plan and in its entirety this is too important for politics first testing testing testing more testing is not only how you find more cases of coronavirus mr president its how you stop the coronavirus cases testing followed by rigorous contact tracing quarantine and isolation protocols for those who have been exposed people arent waiting in lines for miles and miles long in baking hot cars for drive through nasal swabs for the fun of it theyre doing it so they can protect themselves but even more importantly they know when they have this mask on theyre protecting others theyre protecting others we know were not where we need to be in testing there are still hospitals and nursing homes that dont have access to the tests they need testing is how we see whats happening in communities all across the country its our eyes on the ground without that testing were flying blind thats why its so important to have reliable access to testing everywhere we need to increase federal support for testing that includes doubling the number of drive through testing sites and keep increasing them until there are no more lines we should create a pandemic testing board to spearhead a nationwide campaign so every worker every worker whos called back to their job can have the confidence that they and their fellow workers are not infected experts agree that we need more contact tracers to track the path of this virus individual states like new york and california are already hiring and training thousands of tracers but we need to do more including hiring at least federally funded workers to perform contact tracing and other public health tasks and they should begin to be trained now second every single frontline worker should have the personal protective equipment that they need to be safe five months into this crisis and our healthcare workers still are forced to scramble for their own supplies and have to reuse these masks shift after shift hundreds hundreds of healthcare workers have died from covid and tens of thousands have become infected it should', ' be zero on both counts for these healthcare workers if they had the right equipment you know how are we this many months into this and still still dont have what we need thats why we have a defense production act you know mr president use your authority mr president use it this week scale up the production of n masks the steps youve taken so far havent gotten the job done mr president fix the shortage of ppe for our healthcare workers before you tee off another round of golf we cant just look at where we are today were going to need these masks and gloves and face shields for the foreseeable future and we need to be ready we know more is coming thirdly we should be laser focused on treatments and vaccines we should be leading a coordinated global approach on the science not disregarding experts while pushing dangerous and disproved drugs as if theyre treatments theres been some progress toward treatment and vaccines but the administration hasnt been transparent about how they plan to manufacture enough doses to make sure theres equitable distribution to scale i hope theyre doing it now i called for a while ago they should be providing million to have a plan now exactly how theyre going to distribute this so every american has access when and if the vaccines available they may be doing it but we have no transparency let us see mr president the white house should report weekly on this progress we cant end up in the same scratching and distribution problems that we had in testing we need to make sure the customers arent being gouged by new drug and therapies in prices when theyre developed we have to immediately restore our relationship with the world health organization for all its shortcomings and missteps around covid this is why who was created it is essential to coordinating the global response during a pandemic and the united states should be leading that response as we had in the past covid will likely worsen at the outset of flu season this year so we need put in place measures now now to ensure the seasonal flu vaccine can be ready available and administered safely to those who need it under social distancing guidelines especially for seniors fourthly we need real plans real guidelines with uniform nationwide standards to help us chart our economic reopening whatever weve been doing now is not working the state by state approach will only produce confusion and slow any progress you all reported to cdc tried to clear guidelines about what stages of reopening should look like the administration delayed and scaled back those plans we need clear evidence clear evidencebased steps that states can adopt now both the standard must be met in order to safely proceed with further openings and the reposition of social distancing rules when cases begin to rise this is not rocket science we need to support schools and childcare programs so parents if and when they can return to work are confident that their children will be safe and cared for we should be holding them for we should be holding and providing a sticker saying safe for shoppers a certification to stores that prove theyre minimizing their customers risk and exposure we absolutely needed a clear messages from the very top of our federal government that everyone needs to wear a mask in public period period wear a mask its not just about you its ', 'about your family its about your neighbors its about your colleagues its about keeping other people safe it helps you yes but its about keeping other people safe its a simple measure it is also one of the most effective ways we can do the right thing it may be inconvenient it may be uncomfortable but its the right thing to do as an american protect your coworkers and neighbors and finally we need to protect the populations most at risk our seniors our black and brown populations native communities that are being hit the hardest vulnerable populations with preexisting conditions know that this continued growth in case numbers is causing a lot of fear and anxiety people especially older americans and those with loved ones in nursing homes i get calls all the time theyre simply scared theyre frightened this isnt just taking a toll on the physical health its an emotional cost as well we cant expect vulnerable populations to quarantine indefinitely without support i want them to know that their health and safety will be my responsibility if im your president and i will not abandon you these are five fairly straightforward steps that are going to help defeat this pandemic and if you suspect that a lot of these steps are the same sorts of things i was talking about in march when i released my first covid response youd be right if it feels like youre hearing the experts talk about the same issues for months youd be right these have always been the steps that government needed to put in place to meet the threat statewide lockdowns that so many americans lived under for months were intended to buy us time to get our act together instead of using that time to prepare ourselves squandered it now here we are more than three months later were hardly better prepared than we were in march infections are on the rise the threat of massive spikes that overwhelm the capacity of our healthcare system is on the horizon americans anxious and out of work are fearful for their lives and their livelihoods is doing next to nothing about it mr president the crisis is real the crisis is real and its surging mr president your promises and predictions and wishful thinking pulled out of thin air are not only doing the country no good youre making them lose even more faith in their government america knows this crisis isnt behind us even if you dont they see whats happening even if you refuse to mr president they know we need a coordinated national plan we need it now even though you dont mr president and wont do it you called yourself a cheerleader we dont need a cheerleader mr president we need a president mr president a president who will level with the american people a president who will tell us the unvarnished truth a president who will take responsibility instead of always blaming others a president who will listen to the experts follow the science allow them to speak a president who will lead and be an example for the nation wear a mask keep your distance limit the size of crowds mr president this is not about you its about the health and wellbeing of the american public american people dont make enormous sacrifices over the past four months so they could just waste their time and you could waste all the efforts they have undertaken with your midnight rantings and tweets they dont make these sacrifices so you could ignore t', 'he science and turn responsible steps like wearing masks into a political statement and they certainly didnt do it mr president so you could wash your hands and walk away from this responsibility maybe there are times this nation needs a cheerleader now is not one of them america needs a president whatever does or does not do we cant know today what the state of the covid pandemic will be next january but im almost certain i hope i turn out to be wrong im almost certain it wont be over if i should have the honor of being elected president on the day im sworn in ill get right to work implementing all aspects of the response that remain undone ill have more to say about my day one covid agenda in the weeks to come but my response will begin well before i take the oath of office it will start as soon as the election is decided ill be a president who respects scientists who wont censor their ability to speak directly to the american people i will immediately reach out to dr anthony fauci to ask him to continue his incredible service to the country and ill have from day one ready to go the best medical experts and scientists to advise on our response maybe most importantly i will listen to them and let them speak freely and ill work with the governors and mayors of both parties from every state territory and tribe its a simple proposition folks were all in this together we got to fight this together well emerge from this stronger because we did it together and im confident we can may god bless you all and may god protect our troops and im happy to take questions if you have them they gave me a list of how to recognize is alex ap out there couldnt tell when the mask alex well look first of all congress and the intelligence committees on the congress both parties should demand the facts this seems to be a moving story as i was leaving i had the television on as i put on my shirt and i understand theres even some more information thats come out today about what was known one of two things this president talks about cognitive capability he doesnt seem to be cognitively aware of whats going on he either reads andor gets briefed on important issues and he forgets it or he doesnt think its necessary that he need to know it but the fact is that at a minimum at a minimum the discrepancy allegedly within the intelligence community as reported some thought it was more certain and others thought it was less certain that should be resolved the president should have on day one said i want you to come before me in the situation room and lay out the differences and discretions who is saying what lets get to the bottom of it number one number two its clear to me that and i dont know whether he did he should have immediately contacted our joint chiefs of staff gotten them all in one room and sat and said okay what are we doing to prevent this what are we doing to prepare to deal with this if this is happening how are we doing this what are we doing thirdly he should at a minimum have picked up the phone and said vladimir old buddy if any of this is true and it doesnt cease immediately youve got a big problem a big problem and make it clear get to the bottom of this it appears as though from what i have and i dont have access to classified information anymore but if what i have heard over the last week and the recent repor', 'ting that it was in the pdb the presidential daily brief the presidential daily brief is something i read every single day as vice president the president read it every day i was briefed every morning before i got to the white house and then again so the idea that somehow he didnt know or isnt being briefed it is a dereliction of duty if thats the case and if he was briefed and nothing was done about this thats a dereliction of duty i guess the best way for me to end this is i was talking to jill my wife jill and i dont see her get outraged very often but she started asking she said what would you have done if beau was still in harms way and this information came out and the president beau is my son who was im sorry i apologize who served in iraq for a year was in the army but if hed been in afghanistan what would you do what are those parents thinking out there what are those sons and daughters husbands and wives its an absolute dereliction of duty if any of this is even remotely true so i think the president has a lot to answer for and we should get the answers quickly quickly if these allegations are true and he did nothing about any of this then in fact i think the public should unrelated to my running conclude that this man isnt fit to be president of the united states of america i was told nbc mike mikes great relief he doesnt have to follow me every day around the country well this is the most unusual campaign i think in modern history but i start off with the premise mike that im going to follow the docs orders off of the premise mike that im going to follow the docs orders not just for me but for the country and that means that i am not going to be holding rallies i am not going to be for example you all are here but i think the school has put those circles around so we keep the social distancing everybody has masks on as soon as i finish this ill put my mask back on and so its all been almost all been virtual although i have gone to houston i have gone into pennsylvania i have gone to virginia i have traveled but when i do i get in make my case and leave take questions and leave but you know me id much rather be out there with people because thats where i get the greatest feel i can get a sense of what by the look in their eyes by the plaintive voices that they have and what theyre concerned about but notwithstanding that i have been surprised the irony is we probably reach more people directly on oneonone you all particularly those of you who are with television stations you all know that when youre on youre having a onetoone conversation with someone out there because theres one person at the tv looking at you i never quite thought of it that way before but they tell me million people have watched what i have done from home in the half a dozen things weve gone out and done and so the irony is i think were probably communicating directly in detail with more people than we would have otherwise but id much rather be doing it in person so far it remains to be seen i dont want to jinx myself i know the polling data is very good but i think its really early its much too early to make any judgment i think weve got a whole lot more work to do ive planned on laying out in detail my economic plan as to how we recover from this plan on dealing with foreign working out in detail what im going to do ', 'if i am elected president so the people know whats coming i dont know that that answers your question mike but they have not offered a classified briefing and as this proceeds i may very well do that ive been talking to i have a significant foreign policy staff as you know that matter of fact dozens of them so i had a long meeting with my former national security advisors former secretaries of state et cetera and got in their read what theyve heard so far but if it doesnt get cleared up quickly then i will seek and ask if i can be briefed i can hardly wait inaudible well i think there are sort of three categories on that one any institution that chose a name and wants to now jettison that name thats a decision for them to make for whatever reason they make it so im assuming the board of trustees at princeton university made the judgment about the woodrow wilson school i dont know but it was made within the context of an institution that chose that name and now no longer wants to be associated with that name and i think the president is well secondly i think theres a distinction between as the former mayor of new orleans said the difference between reminders and remembrances of history and recovering from history and so the idea of comparing whether or not george washington owned slaves or thomas jefferson owned slaves and somebody who was in rebellion committing treason running trying to take down the union to keep slavery i think theres a distinction there and so i think the idea of bringing down i think all those confederate monuments to confederate soldiers and generals et cetera who strongly supported secession and the maintenance of slavery and going to war to do it i think those statues belong in museums they dont belong in public places and i think with regard to those statues that are in monuments like the jefferson memorial or whatever i think theres an obligation that the government protect those monuments because theyre different than thats a remembrance it is not a dealing with revering somebody who had that view they had much broader views they may have things in their past that are now and then distasteful but thats a judgment for the for example taking down toppling christopher columbus statue george washingtons statue or et cetera i think that is something that is the government has an opportunity and a responsibility to protect from happening no i have not been protected i have not been tested for the coronavirus for two reasons one i have had no symptoms as my mother would say knock on wood and number two i havent wanted to take anybody elses place in the process but the secret service they all get tested theyre around my home and anyone who comes into my home including staff is tested just to determine whether they have the virus i expect what im going to do so it doesnt look like im moving in the front of the line here is be tested relatively soon my daughter has been tested she was in florida shes a social worker working with the boys and girls club she came home and before she could come home shes been tested twice so to make sure shes clear and quarantined she lives in philadelphia but i havent yet i have not been tested yet yes im sorry who was i supposed to go to next anybody i got to make sure i get the wilmington newspaper here before i leave or ill be dead we will the mor', 'e i have an opportunity i will do it i can but i will not but i will tell him heres the deal the idea that putin or any other foreign leader can engage in attempting to manipulate the presidential election the idea that he continues his activities in central and eastern europe that hes doing the idea that it can be done without any consequences is not going to happen if im president in my administration that ranges from everything to making sure we go to the united nations security council all the way to imposing sanctions that would be commensurate with the action that he has taken that is inappropriate but i have had some very blunt straightforward conversations with president putin when i was vice president and before that and i think one of the reasons why it appears as though he doesnt want me to be president he knows well have more blunt conversations one thing i hesitate to do is follow anything the president does at all because he usually does it all wrong we are putting together a list of a group of african american women who are qualified and have the experience to be in the court i am not going to release that until we go further down the line of vetting them as well and just like logical questions about vice president im not releasing the names of all the vice presidential potential nominees there are a number of women of color there are latina women there are asian there are across the board and were just underway now in the hard vet of going into the deep background checks that take anywhere from six to eight weeks to be done the committees have been formed and thats underway well early august i cant guarantee you august but it will be in early august before several weeks before the convention i believe yes yes and that depends look one of the things you try to do ive talked at length over the years with president obama about this you try to find people who have a background and an expertise that you may not have and so one of the reasons president obama picked me is because i had considerable experience in getting things done in the congress and secondly i had considerable experience in foreign policy and national security and although he had clear views of what in fact he wanted to do and what his standard what his strategy was in terms of americas role in the world he was looking for someone that had daytoday experience and knew a lot of those world leaders and so i think that although thats a helpful thing to have its not necessary because i start off with the two places i still have some expertise are in both those places in uniting the country and the congress and foreign policy and so it is almost all of the women im considering have had some exposure to foreign policy and national defense issues and security issues but that is not a minimum requirement requirement is that they have the intellectual capacity as well as the temperament as well as the leadership qualities that lend to everyone to believe that they would be ready on day one to be president of the united states of america with regard to whether or not the president it depends on exactly what he did and what he knew but at a minimum at a minimum he either does and what he knew but at a minimum at a minimum either doesnt understand his job and is having difficulty sitting down and being able to read a report because a', ' lot of those reports come across that he says i didnt read it or i didnt see it or i didnt know it i dont know how he could not read and not see and not know so many different things that have come up over the last three years but it is clearly a dereliction of duty and it is clearly something that i think everyone including my republican friends and my republican opponents in the house and senate are worried about as well thank you all right wheres the delaware state news i mean delaware news channel i should say thats my hometown team i better call on them how are you well i think theyve handled it pretty well so far but now i think youre seeing the make some adjustments because there has been an uptick not tremendous but theres been an uptick it was one of the states that was i get briefed up every day by a group of leading docs around the world around the country vic and dr ben anyway and so every day i get a printout i have it in the book here of the states that are doing better and doing worse up to now there has been a decline and now its opening up slightly i have not spoken to the today but my guess is id only guess is that hes going to be looking very closely what happens on the delaware beaches now how that has occurred and restaurants and bars i dont know enough to know that though the good news is that its flattened out the bad news is theres a slight uptick and i have not gone into the detail of the i speak to him not infrequently but a couple of times a month three four times a month and so i dont have any advice for him yet because i dont know where its popping up thank you im going to get in trouble fire away i know tell them ill be late just a little bit okay all right i always get in trouble on the last question but go ahead well i think the way to get on the same page is to im going to try to say this politely is to lower the rhetoric based on division stop appealing to the less healthy side of society instead of for example when a golf cart goes by yelling white supremacy and the president tweets it out dont do things like that bring the country together were giving a portion of the population who has responded to the sort of race baiting the president has engaged in a sort of free pass and it generates divisions and were also talking about it in terms of the president talks about manhood and being strong and you dont need the mask i think we have to start appealing to the better side of human nature by pointing out that that mask is not so much to protect me its if i have it its to protect you against me its to protect other people and its called patriotism its called responsibility its called making sure you look out for the other person and we have spent too much time if you notice the president puts everything in terms of him and im not being facetious everything is him its i dont think or i dont take responsibility or i didnt do that or i believe that i mean its not about i its about us and i think changing the tone of an administration across the board allowing scientists to speak making sure that people understand the facts good bad and indifferent and when a mistake is made to say i made a mistake i was wrong shouldnt have done it that way we should do it this way i think all those things change the atmosphere let me conclude it by saying this and i apologize youve hear', 'd me say this before the words of a president matter no matter who the president is no matter how responsible or irresponsible the president is a president whomever he or she is can take us to war or bring peace can have markets rise or fall appeal to the senior side of humanity or to our better angels it matters it really matters and so i think its about the tone and i think it goes across the board ill conclude with this i know that i was criticized legitimately criticized during the primaries by saying that i plan on uniting the country bringing democrats and republicans together we have to do that if we cant do that we cant function we have to bring the country together and i think on this piece if in fact we stand up and by the way dont hold me to the numbers please you can correct me on this but i think something like or or of the american people think you should wear a mask the overwhelming number of people think you should take these precautions and so on think we should open more slowly well i think that we should be talking to our better angels and actually making people indirectly feel guilty for not doing the right thing appeal to their better nature i know that sounds almost idealistic but its not remind people you dont wear this mask you end up hurting someone or you get infected you take it home to your child you can take it home to your mother and your father and your husband your wife you have a moral obligation because it really is it really is thank you guys i really do have to go i apologize im going to get in real trouble im probably already in trouble but thank you go ahead whats the last im sorry well i think its very different i think its better if theyre taken down like they took the confederate flag off the mississippi flag thats the better way of doing it but i can understand i can understand the anger and anguish that people feel by having for years and years been under the statue of robert e lee if youre an african american so its a difference its always better to do it peacefully but theres a distinction between i shift responsibility and i think the elected officials where those statues are have a responsibility to move put them in museums get them down but dont expect if you have sitting in front of you after all these years and we finally finally are going through another phase of maybe responding to the systemic racism in america and what weve seen happen is dont be surprised if someone pulls down the statue of jefferson davis its better that they do not but is fundamentally different than pulling down the statue or going to the lincoln memorial and trying to pull a not lincoln memorial thats a bad example the jefferson memorial and grabbing jefferson off his chair oh yes three yeah i commit to it look i am committed to following the debate the national debate group that sets up these debates who they pick as the moderators three of them its been this way for a long time the first one is a oneonone debate with a moderator the next one is led by a town meeting set and a third one is a normal debate again i commit to those im looking forward to them youre a lying dog ive been testing im constantly testing look all you got to do is watch me and i can hardly wait to compare my cognitive capability to the cognitive capability of the man im running against thank you so mu']\n",
            "['well good morning everyone because our safer at home or expires this friday july st at pm dr harris now here once again to provide an update to the current order as well as to what changes will take place going forward after my remarks dr harris will provide the latest covid numbers of alabama as well as where we are in our efforts to try to contain this disease by reducing its transmission treat it the best we can and hopefully get this virus behind us one day in our rear view mirror that day cant come too soon before we get to the updates today i think its only fitting that we make a few comments on the passing of a true alabama civil rights icon john lewis since his death so much has been written and said about congressman lewis itd be hard to add much more to his incredible story and his truly inspirational life but i for one was very pleased that our state led the nation in giving congressman lewis and appropriate and i t', 'hink a very fitting sendoff for a life well lived and a true example of service above self whether it was when his horse drawn carriage paused atop the edmund pettus bridge resting on the red rose petals that contrasted with his own blood that was shed some years ago or having our states troopers stand and salute as the congressman passed over the bridge for one final time alabamians came from all parts of the state to pay their final respects to this proud son of alabama native of troy we are grateful to the lord that we had him for as long as we did and our thoughts some prayers continue with him and his family and friends and all the lives that were touched because of john robert lewis may he rest in peace today with the support of dr harris im extending our current safer at home order until the end of august with a few minor modifications which ill explain in just a minute these decisions are not easy and theyre certainly ', 'not fun and theres no way in the world youre ever going to make everybody happy of the time but one thing is for sure tough decisions are a lot easier to make when youre on the sidelines than when you are actually in the arena now ive said many times since my very first press conference back when we were all still learning how to pronounce coronavirus that when youve been elected youve got to try to do the right thing not necessarily the most popular thing and there is such a fine balance as we have discussed countless times in factoring both the human health as well as economic health into the equation and as ive said before my administration and i have made our share of mistakes during this pandemic but our goal has always been to make more good decisions than bad hopefully leading to more positive results along the way as for todays new order this would include extending our statewide mask ordinance through august st and wh', 'ile no one enjoys wearing a mask id be the first to tell you that because of the help and support weve gotten from our friends in retail and business i believe we are making progress in this arena we just must remain vigilant if were going to get our kids back in school and keep our economy open and wearing a mask cant hurt but it sure can help and more and more people are seeing this for what it is a way to protect yourself as well as to protect the others that you work with come in contact with care about and those you even love and speaking of our schools i want to encourage every superintendent every principal every teacher and every parent whos listening we dont have the luxury of not getting our young people back in school while i respect those districts that have elected to go to virtual classrooms i feel with all my heart that a slide will come by to keeping our kids at home especially if there are other options and th', 'at slide is likely to have a dramatic negative impact on alabamas future our young people so heres a challenge to all of our school districts and each of our schools around the state nothing is set in concrete and if the covid situation in your community or counties permits you should be looking to phase back into in person classroom participation if at all possible now while a majority of safer at home order will remain the same theres one addition to this order that will impact those schools providing in class instruction they will now be required to wear a mask whenever practical from second grade through college we know that with all the responsibilities of being a teacher that this can be an added burden to require that a mask be worn but just as we have focused on creating a safe and healthy environment for our students its also important that we take care of our teachers as well other than our parents one of the most im', 'portant persons in a childs life is the teacher of that child and many of our students and their families rely on school for more than just classroom activities school is a safe place where many of our children get their healthiest meal of the day and where they are loved and encouraged as well as taught as a former school teacher myself and as president of the state school board im telling you we need to do everything we can to get our kids back in the classroom as soon as possible as dr harris makes his way up to the microphone let me again thank the people of alabama for your understanding for your patience for your support and your willingness to help us get through these difficult days dr harris dr harris actually alabamians have died dr harris i want to say thank you to for extending this order i think thats absolutely the right thing to do i fully support that im very aware that many people dont like the idea of having ', 'to wear a face covering and certainly i dont either and i know people dont like being told what to do and i dont either but i do believe that its the right thing to do i know early on dr harris so please let me ask all alabamians to continue to wear these ive been so encouraged to see so many people who are wearing these and who are following the rules that we would like for them to follow as we begin to move towards school reopenings its going to be more important than ever that people will be willing to wear face coverings if we want our schools to minimize the number of cases they have and minimize outbreaks and the risk of closing again we really need people to cooperate with continuing to wear face coverings its really more important now than ever we still have several months to go at least i think in this outbreak and we know well get through it on the other side eventually but we all need to work together and cooperate ', 'and pull together in order to do so thank you very much brian the bottom line is we just simply do not need to close our businesses if at all possible we need to keep our people being able to earn a good livelihood keep the economy going because without a good livelihood you cant have much of a life jen dr harris yeah i would say i dont really have a hard number in mind to serve as a trigger but its a consolation of a lot of things the numbers going up is certainly of concern but also it really matters how hospitals are able to handle that right now they are managing the handle that surge they have ways of creating that space internally they certainly always have the ability to limit the elective things done in hospitals that they need to create space weve talked to many of them about considering doing that we have continued to work with hospitals about the possibility of setting up alternate care sites as well which would be ', 'sort of pop up hospitals outside of the usual hospital setting yes sir well the purpose of the masked mandate was not to penalize people but to inform them of the urgency and the importance inaudible can help provide as we slow down this pandemic so were not worried about that and theres police chief down at spanish fort i believe thats using this as an opportunity to inform people and anybody who needs a mask he gives them so its a cooperative arrangement go ahead when everythings got to be done at the local level decisions made in that regard certainly we want our teachers to be safe as we do our workers at the schools and much less students so its a work in progress and we just got to use good common sense and for those schools that are going virtual say for the first nine weeks my message to them is to do all you can and when things began to improve it a little bit begin to phase back in other students and open up some of ', 'your attendance in the classroom in school yes sir dr harris yeah and they will take place absolutely the facilities have to be safe for kids to come back to school we actually are in the process of releasing a toolkit for not just reopening the physical building but how to bring kids safely back to school weve been developing in conjunction with the department of education and dr mackey it should be released later this week were doing a satellite broadcast webinar next week on tuesday i believe for all the superintendents around the state for school nurses and other school officials so well cover all those things but clearly those are going to have to be safe facilities to come back to speaker dr harris from a inaudible standpoint when you look at the mask mandates what would be your interpretation that inaudible speaker follow up to the questions contact me or the department of public health thank you so much thank yall so m']\n",
            "['good afternoon and happy friday with me is to my right is the woman who needs no introduction the commissioner of the department of health judy persichilli to her right another familiar face the department of healths disease service medical director dr ed lipchitz great to have you both to my left another guy who needs no introduction the superintendent of the state police colonel pat callahan director of the office of homeland security and preparedness jared maples is with us good afternoon first i want to wish everyone in our states wonderful extraordinary muslim community by the way the second largest muslim american community of any american state a blessed eid al adha the festival of sacrifice commemorating gods test of abraham and marking the end of the hajj the pilgrimage to mecca so to all eid mubarak next i must acknowledge sadly the announcement yesterday by the new jersey jewish news that it is ceasing print publication after an impressive year run serving new jersey the news was an important link that connected new jerseys diverse jewish communities and which strengthened the bond between our state and the one hand and the state of israel on the other and i want to give a shout out to our friend ambassador dani dayan his last day as israels console general in new york including service to new jersey is today and we wish him the very best and thank him for his extraordinary partnership over the past two and a half years during our time here the jewish news predates the creation of israel and has covered the news honestly and transparently across its nearly seven and a half decade run the news has fought against the increasing incidents of antisemitism and intolerance across our state when i took my first international economic mission as i made sure it included a stop in israel a key trading and business partner and as always the jewish news was there to cover it so to all the reporters and editors who over the years have put out the paper edition new jersey jewish news every shabbat thank you and i hope the news will continue in an online format you are all a vital part of a vital force for the good a vital voice and force for the good next i must note i would be remiss if i did not that senate republican leader mitch mcconnell sent the senate home for a long weekend without taking any action on a long list of items but especially to renew unemployment federal unemployment benefits that have now expired for millions of families here in new jersey and many more millions nationwide with millions of families literally left hanging to simply go home for a long weekend is the ultimate act of irresponsible behavior and dereliction of duty senator mcconnell please get back to washington and get this done families across our state and indeed across the nation are facing literally an economic meltdown on your watch and this is no time to take a weekend nevermind a long weekend off despicable now before we turn to the overnight numbers i am proud to announce that were making a series of improvements this is a inaudible chart pat to our online dashboard that will provide a deeper look into and provide greater context to judy is laughing as well the data that we discuss here every day we receive a summary from ed and his team at the communicable disease service which provides a detailed overview of cases and data pertaining to hospitalizations and deaths that data will now be put in a more interactive and easy to navigate form the dashboard available at covidnjgov will provide statewide and county level trends in covid confirmed cases deaths and hospitalizations over time we are posting the percent positivity by region and by date and the number of cases can now be viewed by the date of illness onset the breakdowns by race and ethnicity are given greater clarity and we are also posting the complete curve of confirmed cases by date of death as well as the dates of the deaths we currently have listed as probable throughout this pandemic we have occasionally made tweaks to the way we present data to provide greater context or clarity and todays upgrades to the dashboard continue that work and i must thank j', 'udy and ed and their teams for their ongoing efforts so if you go to the dashboard you will see that we are today reporting an additional positive test results pushing the total number of cases of coronavirus in new jersey since march th to before i move on id like to note that even with the increases we have seen in the latest case numbers new jersey remains among the ten states nationwide with the lowest number of active cases per capita i want to warn you in advance youre going to get on the one hand on the other hand today because the other hand were going to be pretty tough on it as well the positivity rate for tests recorded for july which is the latest day for which we had that data is that is also not quite as good as its been but thats pretty darn good we have continued to increase our volume of testing over the past couple of weeks and as a result we remain among the five states with the lowest daily percent positivity again one of the top ten cases in lowest number of active cases per capita and we remain among to repeat the five states with the lowest daily percent positivity i want to add that i had a good conversation with the executive chairman of bioreference this morning john cohen to talk through in particular how we can all work together as weve mentioned several times judy over the past few weeks to shrink that turnaround time its too uneven and for the most part its too long and we had a good call with john side by side with that we also continue ramping up our contact tracing capabilities and working with local health departments to identify causes of outbreaks that have contributed to recent increases in our cases and judy and i will have more on that next week both i would bet technologically but also an update here in person however the increases in new cases we have seen over the past week has pushed the statewide rate of transmission to and given the recent data on cases we anticipate unfortunately that it will go higher in the days ahead so heres on the other hand look the numbers are setting off alarms that we are taking and we take very seriously we still may be among the leaders in having the lower case numbers and daily positivity rates we dont take that for granted but we are standing in a very dangerous place as i said the alarms are going off the only way to silence these alarms and get back to the process of moving forward is for everyone to take them seriously not just most of you but all of you all of us we are not past this everyone who walks around refusing to wear a mask or who hosts an indoor house party or who over stuffs a boat is directly contributing to these increases this has to stop and it has to stop now as a reminder the limit on indoor gatherings is the lesser of either individuals or of capacity meaning if your capacity is say then you can have no more than people inside its the lesser of or individuals and i want to reiterate that i and we reserve the right to lower this threshold if necessary to protect public health im not anticipating or announcing i should say any specific action today but consider this as being put on notice we will not tolerate these devil may care nonchalant attitudes any longer pat is going to have a couple of specific comments on compliance and hes got one thing in particular that relates to indoors that he will hit hard and i will be happy to come in behind you and hit hard as well now back to the data and ill look at yesterdays report from our hospitals as of last night there were covid confirmed patients being treated with an additional judy persons under investigation pending the return of their test results thats a total of hospitalizations of those required intensive care and ventilators were in use overall the trends in our hospitals continue to move our healthcare system in the right direction and as these numbers keep moving down so do we in the national rankings and the important healthcare metrics sadly however we continue to lose members of our extraordinary new jersey family to covid and today we must report another ten confirmed deaths and losses of blessed lives of these judy you and i talked about this earlier', ' seven occurred in the past five days and three of those were on july the only day with more than one confirmed death of late this is a big deal and i know judy is going to want to come in behind this as well as of the latest hospital data there were no and i repeat no zero in hospital deaths reported over the hour period ending at pm last night that is the first day that we can say that that is the case since march th days ago almost five months ago and youve asked us folks will we get one of those days and we said wed get it we just didnt know when it was the hours that ended last night so i think were all going to just take a quick moment and reflect on that again the first day we can say that since march ten well this is an extraordinary milestone let me just remind folks and judy and ed correct me if you think im wrong about this im going to say about a month ago is about when you would have been plus or minus infected and i know theres some that were a lot longer and some that were shorter that would have led to a death around now if you look at the number of positives that we were reporting at the end of june as we are in the end of july it was averaging about a day there were a couple of days higher and there were a couple of days lower in that last week of june this past week the average eye balling it and again a big number today a somewhat lesser number yesterday lets smooth that out is averaging about so lets just remember deaths or lack of deaths thank god in this case reflect positive cases this is a lagging indicator of what we were seeing and again im simplifying about a month ago about a day of positive cases this past week a day of positive cases so not only do we commemorate reflect and celebrate zero deaths in our hospitals over the past hours we have to also acknowledge the number of positive cases is meaningfully higher right now on average than it was a month ago the total number of lost lives that are confirmed lab confirmed and the number of probable deaths remains at as we do every day lets recall three more of the blessed members of our new jersey family who we have lost we begin by remembering dominick on the left and shirley on the right dstefan of florham park which they called home for years dstefan their family walked me through this dominicks ancestors came from italy their name was in fact distefano but in the lost in translation reality of ellis island the eye behind the d got flipped into an apostrophe and the o at the end of distefano got dropped so they are dstefan the proudly italian americans dominick was born in the chambersburg section of trenton in the house by the way that his father a mason built by hand and i think it was his dad who was the one who came over and immigrated as first generation at the onset of world war ii dominick enlisted in the us navy and served as a radar technician aboard the light cruiser the uss wooster from that posting he developed a lifelong interest in electronics after the war he earned a degree in electrical engineering under the gi bill from temple university but his budding career in the field was short circuited when he was recalled to the navy to serve during the korean war after his second tour of duty dominick earned his masters in management sciences from the stevens institute of technology and began a career with bell labs where he would work on the telstar project the first successful transmission of a radio wave to a target in space and back but more importantly to a target in space and back but more importantly it was at bell labs that he met shirley upon his retirement from at he began a career teaching mathematics and engineering at the county college of morris retiring in his s dominic had a lifelong love of music and was an accomplished trumpeter and trombonist a member by the way of the musicians union he played in orchestras as well as in major parades his favorite song as was my late fathers favorite song was hoagy carmichaels american classic stardust im dating myself just one week after dominick passed shirley too lost her battle with covid shirley was born in carney attended carny high school and uppsala coll', 'ege and as we know now she also started working at bell labs after their marriage shirley and dominick by the way she called him dom they settled in florham park to raise their daughter donna shirley would go back to work as a school bus driver for the florham park board of education and became a beloved fixture in the life of the community and in the lives of the thousands of children she transported to and from school she knew where each one lived what their likes were and recalling something special about their personalities after hanging up her bus keys shirley took an active interest in gardening and birdwatching making the weekly trip to agway on senior citizens tuesday for various bird seeds and treats for her feathered friends she loved all animals and never minded when the neighborhood deer stopped by to snack on the seeds she put out she loved to sew and bake pies and to travel the world dominick and shirley were both longtime and active parishioners at grace episcopal church in madison for over years when they passed he was and she was they leave behind as i mentioned their daughter donna and her husband dennis and i had the honor to speak with both of them so as we send them off i want to quote hoagy carmichael and say though i dream in vain in my heart it will remain my stardust melody the memory of loves refrain may god bless them both we thank dominick for his years of service to our nation next we remember john kupcho on the left and look at his family on the right my lord of west caldwell jack as he was known was jack served in the us air force and earned a bachelor of science and ornamental horticulture from the university of tennessee then came to new jersey to earn his master of science and environmental science in urban planning from rutgers university he would have a long career at rutgers beginning in as the essex county agricultural agent at the rutgers cooperative extension helping commercial vegetable growers in bergen essex morris and passaic counties to maximize resources to increase crop yields jack would ultimately serve as chairman of the department of agricultural resource management agents at rutgers cook college jack developed the masters gardner program for northeastern new jersey he organized leaf composting and groundwater education programs and worked with the newark urban gardening program a program which was chosen for the take pride in america award in jack accepted that award from president ronald reagan at the white house for as more than half century of teaching advising and improving agriculture jack received the new jersey board of agricultures distinguished service to agriculture award he also held the title of professor emeritus at rutgers cook college in jack and his first wife maryanne who by the way sadly passed away at the very young age of they took over the pine florist in verona and he was often in the greenhouses giving advice to novice gardeners and veteran horticulturists alike jack was involved with many local groups including the west caldwell environmental commission which honored him last august by renaming the west caldwell community gardens in his honor horticulture was his professional love but jack took special pleasure in his family and you could see he had a big one especially being part of his grandchildrens lives he was also dont hold this against him or me a lifelong red sox fan an affliction which paid off late in life with their world championship runs jack is survived by his wife helen and shes not well either so please pray for her his daughters terry and i had the great honor of speaking with terry mary ellen kathy who by the way is a council woman in west caldwell coleen and their spouses and by his grandchildren we thank him for his many years of service to new jerseys farmers and gardeners hes a big reason why we still proudly call us the great garden state may god bless him his memory and his extraordinary family three more members of our new jersey family who covid has taken away three more reasons why we cannot let up one bit in doing all we can to stop the spread of this virus to save lives i reiterate what weve been sayin', 'g here all week and frankly for the past several weeks use your common sense we all want to get back to things the way they were but right now that is just not possible keep social distancing keep wearing a mask and please remember indoor parties are just a bad idea period now switching gears this morning the news broke that the census bureau will be ending its doortodoor efforts one month earlier than originally planned on september th meaning that we need you to make sure you are counted now we cannot overstate the importance of an accurate count of all new jerseyans in the census its about protecting billion every year in aid for our schools our health care facilities and our communities thats billion over a decade if youre counting at home its about making sure every family has healthy food to eat and that our roads and transit systems are funded its about making sure that we have what we need to rebound from this pandemic its about making sure we get back every dollar from washington that we deserve so far roughly two and a half million households or of all new jersey households have already responded to the census thats a good number but right now were only good enough to rank st among all states in responding we need everyone to be counted last weekend faith leaders took to their pulpits and asked their worshipers to fill out the census and by monday we saw our numbers going up so i want to thank those faith leaders each and every one of them and we ask you folks to continue engaging your congregations please take time to go to censusgov today to make sure you and your family are counted then reach out to your friends and neighbors and make sure they are too we know new jersey was under counted in and because of that we have lost out on literally billions and billions of dollars of extra federal funds over the past decade and the news that the census bureau will stop its direct outreach one month early means that unless you do your civic duty we will be counted again in an undercount will almost certainly mean especially that our communities of color will be left out there will be hundreds of activities across the state this weekend to push residents to get counted you could find one near you by the way going to censusnjgov censusnjgov communities across the state have challenged each other to see who can outperform the other lets all be a part of the census lets show how strong new jersey is by getting counted today again go to censusgov a couple of others items the last dance of the last dance is tonight right here in trenton at arm hammer park cranford against jackson cranford won the north jackson won the south it should be a barn burner hats off to each and every member of those teams and their managers and coaches but also to every single team who participated this as hard as covid is to deal with only two teams out of could not play out their entire string so to the organizers to the inspiration the folks who had the inspiration to this tournament and to each and every one of the participants hats off to each and every one of you now finally i want to continue to highlight the small businesses and business leaders who are not only such a strong of our communities but who will be a vital part of our longterm economic recovery we know this pandemic has been nothing short of an economic crisis as much as it has been a public health crisis and that is why i am proud of the work of the new jersey economic development authority to pump million directly into our small business sector one of those small businesses were proud to have partnered with is joys hallmark of marlton owned by ron and joy monokian theyve been in business since helping their customers celebrate holidays birthdays weddings graduations and frankly everything else in between but when the pandemic hit their store took a hit too through the eda ron was able to secure direct grant assistance which when paired with the support he received through the federal government meant the joys hallmarks employees could be kept on the payroll and that the bills could be paid to keep the store running i had the great pleasure of speaking with r', 'on on wednesday afternoon and i know he shares our optimism in the days ahead although he reminded me hes still off of where it was last year so while hes optimistic hes still making up for lost time hes also by the way a member of both the burlington and ocean city chambers of commerce and i share his support of all the small business owners who have been working hard to keep their dreams alive throughout this pandemic were going to get through this together and were going to come out stronger together that goes by the way not just for our small business community that goes for each and every one of our entire state lets keep working together to push this virus back down so i want to wish everybody a safe weekend again keep your social distances wear a mask and please no house parties no overstuffed boats we cannot afford any more irresponsible outbreaks weve also got some weather coming down the pike which pats going to talk about in a few minutes we could do this folks were new jersey we have never backed down from a fight and weve never lost we always punch above our weight we always get there unlike any american state we cannot let our hair down were not out of the woods this is not past us were seeing real evidence of that so folks stay together keep doing the right things behave responsibly common sense for the common good for yourself your family your neighbors your friends for all of us now it is my pleasure to turn things over to the woman who needs no introduction the commissioner of the department of health judi persichilli judith persichilli today we are further investing in the public health infrastructure by making million in federal funding available to county and local health departments million of the cdc funding will be allocated to health departments in each of the counties and the city of newark which are responsible for preparedness coordination in their jurisdictions these health departments are known as lincs agencies lincs stands for local information network and communications systems this funding will allow these agencies to hire additional employees to coordinate testing contact tracing and isolation and quarantine activities in their communities in collaboration with the local health departments these new positions will provide data management and epidemiological support to all local health departments and contact tracing teams within their areas theyll help individuals exposed to covid with the needs such as housing food mental health and medical services and other social supports and they will ensure testing contact tracing isolation and quarantine and social support services are conducted in a timely and complete manner judith persichilli previously healthy young individuals to years of age werent back to usual health in two to three weeks after testing positive this lingering illness may lead to prolonged absences from work studies or other activities so researchers are beginning to study the longer term effects of covid and some studies have indicated that the virus can damage the heart in addition there are many anecdotal stories of individuals that had the illness who are still struggling with fatigue and difficulty breathing months later this should be a sobering reminder to healthy residents especially young individuals that this disease is serious you could be battling cough fatigue or shortness of breath for weeks or months again there are still a lot we dont know about the disease and its health effects so it is not worth taking unnecessary risks we must continue to take precautions staying a safe distance from others wearing face coverings and practicing good hand hygiene judith persichilli our daily percent positivity as of july in the state is the northern part of the state reports the central part of the state and the southern part of the state as the announced we are adding additional data to our dashboard i want to thank ed he is the developer of the dashboard to provide more context about how covid unfolded in our state and our counties under the tab titled case summary you can view the trends the mentioned you can also select individual dates and date rang', 'es to see the data more granularly we are adding data on age adjusted case and mortality rates by race and ethnicity which allows for a fair comparison between the groups with different age distributions and earlier this week we posted a new tab with hospital discharge data broken down by age gender race and ethnicity that concludes my daily report as always stay connected stay safe stay healthy get tested mask up and for each other and for us all please take the call thank you judy great report and thank you for everything i have begun to get read in more recently more anecdotal than science based a friend bill leferett up in mahwah first raised with me a number of weeks ago this whole notion of what theyre now calling long haulers as in long haul truckers but this reality of the lingering health challenges i mentioned the red sox earlier theyve got a pitcher right now whos got an inflamed heart muscle in his heart but he tested negative now after having tested positive weeks ago theres fatigue you mentioned whole range of challenges many of which we probably dont know yet to your very good point that creates another health challenge that were going to have to collectively deal with obviously because were going to be there for those people but its another reminder that once you get sucked in by this it could linger in your system in your body for a long time so the consequences may god forbid are not life and death but as weve seen with thousands and thousands of folks who have lost their lives it is an addition to that you may get through this as most people do but you may bring with you health realities that could go on for a long time so thank you for highlighting that pat tropical storm is on our list which is not covid but thats something that would potentially complicate our lives compliance again you and i are not happy with indoor behavior any update on that front and any other matters pat at two oclock if were done by two i will be on with the national weather service and if not emergency management command will be on and then at three oclock this afternoon i will be on with region two administrator tom vanessan and his staff again pointing to our phenomenal partnership with fema making sure that were ready should this tropical storm evolve into a hurricane at this juncture were thinking hopefully its going to be mostly a rain event similar to tropical storm fay but in emergency management we always say you can never be over prepared so thats all i got gov pat could you repeat just for a second and make sure everyone hears this what the diner was cited for this is indoor okay i mean we couldnt be clearer every single darn day its quite clear what works and what doesnt work and i will tell you this anecdotal evidence that weve heard of other behavior like that and as i said i mentioned were putting up the alarms and the flashing lights right now whether its enforcement or changing our policy you should assume were not going to sit and take this much longer on the storm plus or minus when does that hit new jersey based on what you know and i know youve got your call still ahead of you i know i speak on behalf of judy ed jared the rest of us if you have to go to take the call were better off for it we wont be offended so thank you thank you all i think well start over here were going to be a virtual tomorrow and sunday and were one oclock on monday we just got where the white house is going to be at like four oclock or three oclock i think on monday so well be able to hold our regular times and we also reserve the right to revisit this three a week format if things go south youll see more of us but hopefully that wont happen again virtual tomorrow and sunday unless you hear otherwise and well be together with you in person at one on monday aswans got the mic dustin good afternoon dustin do you still stand by the billion figure for projected losses or do you plan to revise that figure given some of the fears and anxieties that teachers and faculty have about returning to school in the fall would you be willing to allow teachers and school workers the option of working remotely as you gave that opti', 'on to parents for their children and lastly on the eviction moratorium obviously tenants are struggling to pay their rent but then on the flip side you have a lot of landlords who havent collected rent in six months do you have any timeline for ending the moratorium or do you have any plans to address that issue thanks thank you dustin i have to say based on what we know the outside reality is not our problem at the moment and judy unless you would see it otherwise we dont have evidence and again theres a mountain of data that were plowing through all the time we just have not seen the evidence that the outside reality is our problem it is the inside reality and that is something that we are its no secret at this point because as ive said it several times that is something were looking hard at i dont have an update on the billion number dustin but thats something that were going to continue to look at and boy i wish we had resolution on the federal cash assistance for states not only did they walk away off the bridge of the ship in the senate leaving individuals hanging who are barely hanging on by a thread but youve got states all over the country that are barely hanging on by a thread i think on the educators side by the way we had a good meeting with some of the leadership and the educators our team and their team yesterday and the districts are in the last stages of putting their plans together i think well leave that to the district plans and see what they have and what they are actually planning as weve said many times no two districts are alike but one of the asks a rightful ask of educators has been capacity in the classroom and one of the ways that we wanted to give relief not just to parents to give them flexibility and kids at districts but also as explicitly to educators and that task was to give that remote learning flexibility and option particularly when we found the resources to close the digital divide and so that is indirectly not just helping the family and kids where that makes sense but its also helping the educators by lowering capacity yeah i asked the last night the moratorium matt plackin is with us i think will last up to as i recall two months after i declare an end to the health emergency number one and number two symmetry has been at the core of a lot of the rental and mortgage holidays and windows that weve created in other words if youre a landlord with a mortgage over here would ask the mortgage bankers to get off your back and give you a holiday and likewise that allows you to give the people who are renting from you whether its a house or an office or whatever it might be a holiday on that side and that symmetry is still at the center of all of the windows that weve created what we dont want i was asked this last night people playing games and going circuitous only through one legal avenue when they know that that has a higher chance of being able to circuit our executive order or secondly that on day one following the end of the window whether youre a renter or you have a mortgage or youre a mortgage payer we dont want and dont expect that youre going to have a lump sum payment to make on day one of that post holiday period were working with the legislature matt unless im mistaken we need statutory authority so we need laws to be passed and were working with them so that theres a plan that more than asking or hoping that the mortgage lender or the landlord would behave that way there is something like for every month that youve had a window of you havent had to pay your mortgage you have a six month window to make that up something like that anything you want to add or are you good window to make that up something like that anything you want to add or are you good youre good thanks inaudible please is that it i havent personally spent a whole lot of time on this but we know the issue and our team is working with as i said theres legislative fixes that would partially if not entirely address that theres also behavior that we expect out of folks but we understand that this is a challenge ive got it by the way in my own family and so thats something that is a work in progr', 'ess i dont know matt if you want to add anything or you so bear with us on that but thats part of the legislative fix that were trying to get to youve got anything sir alex are you good that would be a conversation i could have with myself because i am a parent of a kid going back to school gyms full bore opening i dont its just not were not there yet limited and when we do get there your question i think was could you see it being done with some limitations capacity or otherwise yes just as indoor dining i think i dont want to put words in your mouth but weve talked for weeks now about having indoor dining all the capacity restrictions social distancing hyper hygiene and liquors bar service only to the table as opposed to any gathering around the bar so yes the answer is when we do get there on gyms and i say when well get there well get there on indoor dining it will be with some restrictions we do schedule we allow scheduled right now but only for either individuals or people in the same bubble which is overwhelmingly people in the same family or who are living under the same roof and i hope believe me that we get to a better place what are we looking at in terms of judy im going to hit this and then see if youre want to add anything where whats a red line that we might be at which would trigger potential policy or enforcement steps i think you should assume were there so i dont think we have to you wont have to wait a lot longer unless we see we better have a big weekend that would really help but assuming that the trends of late keep going where theyre going were in that neighborhood right now i cant tell you exactly what but overwhelmingly were focused on indoor really its two things right indoor activity and judy and all that she has done and all that were trying to do to manage outofstate travel coming in here in new jersey and those who have gone outofstate coming back in here we frankly dont see a whole lot coming from that second reality its were still getting our arms around that because were asking a lot of individuals it is overwhelmingly though indoor activity high congregation lack of ventilation what i would say as a parent or to a parent and i am a parent is a couple of things ive already said but i want to repeat because its a very good question dont expect a normal school year and i think if youve got that expectation youre going to be disappointed this is going to be unusual just look at the moment that were in not just as a state but as a nation and the world its not going to be normal secondly we will try to get as much flexibility as humanly possible into the system including reserving the right based on the data that weve just discussed to make decisions iteratively as we go forward thirdly remember that we have three big principles number one health number two best education possible number three equity and that gets to a point it depends on who the parent is is it a home with an extra room for the kid to easily remote learn multiple devices not both parents arent working so they dont have to worry about putting their living at risk or the daycare challenges that would come from having a child at home remember that on the other hand there are households whether its there are two working parents or a single mom or dad or the circumstances of their density of their living where the inperson option is the only option that theres really any plan b is a poor either doesnt exist or its a poor substitute for the inperson piece and i would say lastly that we will do it working with the districts and theyve done an extraordinary job well do it as responsibly as possible so that if youre in the school youre going to see social distancing enforced face masks and coverings enforced hyper hygiene limitations on capacity however they get there in that district it depends on the district because as ive said theres no two districts alike but know that normalcy is not within our grasp right now lets all accept that lets take our hats off to everybody the districts the supers the boards the educators the parents the kids themselves the staff that are all trying to get this right know that well do', ' it as responsibly as humanly possible and were going to go through this together thank you katherine is that you how are you good its hard to see people these days how are you i dont have a specific answer for the number on the second one but we can get it for you inaudible will you follow up with katherine i assume it is of million which is the number of people who have made a claim so whatever the of that number would be is around sounds to me like around but thats well come back to you and by the way i had asked the last night you all have been very good about raising issues that are overwhelmingly specific to the individual early on there were there was a weekend when the system crashed and that held us back a couple of days thats overwhelmingly not the case these days its very specific to the individual i think if we take any steps were not going to wait a whole lot longer i cant give you an exact date and again if we have a really good weekend and start to the week then well reconsider that but we whether its the policies in place the enforcement and the teeth with which although weve got a fair amount of teeth theres no question about that but were looking at it real time thank you for that good to see you matt is that it i dont think we have any that we know out of the jackson house party yet is that correct folks ed and i think you mentioned this earlier one of the two of us did judy that means were almost certain would be shocked if there werent cases sadly that came out of that so the numbers if anything are going up but i dont believe that theyre involved in that when was the last day we were at this number of positives rate a transmission i dont know but well get that for you matt did you hear that last day we were at where we are today which is i wont comment on a district plan not that im afraid to comment on it but i need to know a lot more about what the districts look like their rationale and i know the department of education would be forget about me the department of education who are the education experts and judy and her team as the health experts would want to look at that and understand our team had a very constructive meeting and i was back and forth with leadership myself with one of the big unions and listen i think everyone is trying to do the get to the right place here and i commend the fact that everyone is doing that and whether or not were exactly in the right place right now is a lot less of concerning or interest to me than is there a spirit of cooperation and teamwork trying to get to the right place recognizing as i said to alex earlier this is not a normal and it wont be a normal school year so bear with us on that again this is the districts are polishing off their plans and both department of ed department of health and our team on the front office will be going through that process quick swig im going to mask up judy if thats all right with you again judy and ed thank you pat likewise good luck on your calls i think we got you in just a couple of minutes before jared matt inaudible inaudible thank you all virtually or electronically tomorrow and sunday in person at one oclock on monday unless we say otherwise folks please weve done an extraordinary job as a state but the game is not over there is still time on the clock i wish we could tell you how much time there is on the clock but were not out of the woods and if you have any doubt look at whats going through going on in other states never mind a resurgence of positive cases in our state we have to repeat again judy it is a big day notwithstanding the increase in cases that for the first time in days we had no deaths in our hospitals and that cannot be understated or underestimated again as important as that milestone is its a lagging indicator of people who are getting infected plus or minus many weeks ago but folks keep doing a great job please cut out the indoor gatherings where people are on top of each other not socially distanced not wearing face coverings thats not going to work thats going to get us in more and more trouble as a state and will risk peoples health and lives thank you everybody god bless']\n",
            "['well good afternoon i want to thank broward health for hosting us before i begin i want to thank the emergency management personnel throughout the state of florida they prepared for isaias and we did not get the major impact that we were prepared for which is a very good thing but we did get a good trial run for what will likely be a busy hurricane season in particular we had the opportunity to beta test the new sheltering strategy which we had to evolve in light of the coronavirus the state of florida sent ppe kits and thermometers to all shelters in the storms path and arranged for noncongregate sheltering options for people who either had or were suspected of having covid and it all proved to be very helpful in palm beach for example we had people show up to a shelter that had tested positive recently or who did not pass the temperature screening and those people redirected to a nearby hotel where they had a safe place to stay until the storm passed i would just tell floridians theres been a lot of activity up to this point in the season we do anticipate more storms developing so make sure that you have a plan well hope for the best on this but we absolutely need to be prepared for more storms im really glad to be here with broward health we have gino santorio the president ceo we have josh lenchus doctorchief medical officer cheryl wild chief nursing officer and dave lacknauth executive director of pharmacy services for broward health theyre going to talk about some of the things that weve been working on in conjunction with them i think that theyve done a really good job i think everyone throughout south florida has done a fantastic job frontline healthcare workers in the hospitals in responding to this crisis we are looking at im going to make an announcement today about testing which i think will be helpful but we are encouraged by some of the trends were seeing we continue to see a downward trend in visits to the emergency department with people with covidlike illnesses weve seen a peak in covid positive patients that are hospitalized statewide happened the third week in july weve continued to see that census decline and i think that that is consistent with what theyve seen here at broward health today we reported one of the lowest numbers of tests that weve positive tests that weve reported in a long time and weve had two days in a row where the positivity has been which we were there for a while these are encouraging trends obviously theres a lot more work to do and one of the reasons why were here today is because we want to addres', 's the remaining challenges one is the turnaround time for testing when we started going to expand testing in may we thought that if we could get up to tests a day that that would really really be doing well remember in march and april we were doing tests a day there obviously was a need for more capacity so we worked to do that we have done a lot more than just we typically will get in roughly test results in a given day you are also seeing more and more testing throughout the country the result of that has been turnaround times of a lot of the commercial labs have just been moved to the right more and more you have longer wait times obviously if youre somebody that is symptomatic and if you dont get your results back for seven days that is not helpful for our asymptomatic test takers if it takes seven days then the test is basically useless at that time because even if you were infectious at the minute you tested by the time you get it back you probably havent been isolating anyways and youre likely to not be infectious on the backend of that so increasing the times is something that were looking to i asked jared moskowitz to make some changes to try to do that so starting tomorrow were going to have some real positive changes were actually going to convert two of our sites in miamidade county the marlins stadium and hard rock stadium to exclusively minute antigen tests the tests will be for people that have symptoms or for elderly and older there will still be a lane for the traditional testing for the other asymptomatic people but that will be the traditional swab with the traditional lab but for those folks who are older or who are symptomatic or both youre going to be able to go in get the antigen tests and in minutes walk out with a result thats not only good for the test taker and the patient its also good for officials monitoring the trends when we get tests reported to the state sometimes those tests were taken days before certainly the infections in many cases happened to days before so if youre looking at things like the positivity rate or some of these other things a lot of times that data can be stale now were going to get every day at these two sites total of tests were going to be able to get realtime data about the percent testing positive the number of people testing and so i think it will be really really good people want to know and want those results back what every other drive through site throughout the state of florida we are going to have symptomatic lanes this will be people that are experiencing coronavirus symptoms ', 'or are or both and they will be able to selfswab so they selfswab we have relationships with certain labs that once we get them the swabs we usually get a hour turnaround from the time the lab receives it so if we can get it to them as quick as possible they typically turn it around well this will be i think very good so its not going to be seven days which is whats been happening so hopefully it will be more of a to hour window which i think is a big deal when youre talking about this and of course there will be a lane for people who are asymptomatic were also going to offer at all these sites antibody testing and its something to think about because think weve seen with more of the research and the data thats come out particularly over the last few weeks cdc has now moved to a symptoms based approach for employees going back to work theyre discouraging needing to get a negative pcr test and i think part of the reason that the antibody test may make sense for people that dont have symptoms is pcr tests can pick up dead virus cdc says up to weeks but certainly we know people who have tested positive for days and days beyond the day period thats not an uncommon thing so if youre asymptomatic and youre testing we really cant tell you for sure whether you have live virus once we get those results now some people may still want to do pcr its going to be there but the antibody tests well be able to tell you whether you have the antibodies and whether you have been infected and if you have igm antibodies then you likely had a more recent infection if you have igg antibodies likely were infected a little bit further back in the past so thats very valuable information for people to know whether they have the antibodies and what weve seen is since we opened up antibody testing to the general public we used to do it for the healthcare workers and for the first responders weve opened it up weve seen the antibody rates increase throughout florida and some days well of the test takers will be positive for antibodies now its not scientifically representative because its just first come first serve but i think that theres a surprising amount of antibodies out there so if folks want to do that were going to be able to do it but its all about lab prioritization understanding that there is a limited lab capacity for a quick turnaround and if we can focus on those people who really need the test results the quickest i think were going to be able to improve so youre going to have two sites with instant tests and then youre going to have the other drive through s', 'ites with the self its with instant tests and then youre going to have the other drive through sites with the self swab and quicker turnaround at the lab option which im really excited about were also working very closely with all the hospitals throughout the state of florida as we look down with this coronavirus crisis the two things that i think were just so important to get right were doing everything we could to protect the vulnerable particularly those in longterm care facilities but then be there to support our frontline healthcare workers and our hospital systems remember when we did the whole flatten the curve in march and april that was all just to buy time to be able to make sure that the hospital system could cope with the pandemic and weve worked really hard with all the hospitals as theyve had needs weve worked really hard to respond with any assistance we can buy so for example with this remdesivir which is one of the top therapeutics that doctors are now offering weve gotten cases delivered to the state of florida which is vials and as hospitals ran low we had to go to the white house and get the schedule expedited and be able to get more remdesivir in the hands of our frontline physicians i think broward health they were going low and then they got replenished before they ran out and thats what we were trying to do were also promoting convalescent plasma donations hospitals do need this its high demand it can be an effective treatment and so were going to continue to encourage people throughout the state of florida to give blood if you do have the antibodies if youve recovered from an infection to go give the blood thats one of the reasons having the antibody lanes at these test sites are good because if you do test positive you can go get blood and you can help potentially save a life its very very important were also helping hospitals with personnel when the pandemic really got hot and heavy in march the fear that was put out was about running out of hospital beds that never was really a threat in the state of florida in march april may but then as we got into and started seeing the prevalence increase admissions we reached out to hospitals and said what do you need hows your day bed capacity and actually to a man they all said the bedroom is great we just need to make sure should we have enough personnel to staff the beds that we have and sure enough thats been the case weve had bed capacity the whole time certain areas of the state because of the increased admissions those frontline workers work extremely extremely hard pa', 'rticularly in dade and broward and so we were able to send medical personnel to hospitals we have more at my direction that can be deployed of the personnel are working right here at broward health so these are personnel that we didnt necessarily use in march and april may and the beginning of june but we had the arrangements in place so that if we needed to do it we could do it and i think that thats been a huge huge source of help i mean the amount of just their lives that theyve had the juggle if youre a frontline healthcare worker throughout the whole time has been tough but particularly once we saw the increase in prevalence at the end of june throughout july its been very very difficult and so to be able to provide some level of support there i think that thats a very good use of resources and im glad we were able to do it and finally i think were supporting the hospitals protecting the vulnerable we have now established covid exclusive nursing facilities throughout the state thats over beds and in broward we have three covid exclusive facilities throughout the state or throughout the county with a total of nearly beds and what that allows you to do one it allows you to limit an outbreak in a nursing home if someone tests positive they can be safely transferred to a covid only physical it also allows a hospital if they have a longterm care resident whos medically stable they know they cant discharge a sick patient back to the new nursing home because that would obviously create risk of spread but they can discharge to a covid exclusive facility so it helps prevent outbreaks in nursing homes or limit outbreaks in nursing homes and then it also helps the hospitals be able to manage their beds and if they have patients in there who dont require hospitalization if it is an infected nursing home resident theres a safe place to transfer where youre not going to run the risk of furthering the spread so we really appreciate the facilities here in broward stepping up to do this and the hospitals i think have worked really well with our secretary mary mayhew and i think its really been successful we have beds almost there are over but we have probably hundreds of more that are going to be online so i want to thank all the healthcare workers throughout the state that have been working tirelessly to support your fellow floridians in a very difficult time we appreciate the sacrifice were going to continue to support and remember there are certain things that all floridians can do look out for our vulnerable population make sure youre exercising good', ' hygiene exercising appropriate physical distancing such as avoiding crowded spaces closed areas and close contact and then wearing a facial cover particularly if you cant maintain that six footed difference floridians have really stepped up to the plate and done a great job as i said got a lot of work to do trends are a lot better today than they were a month ago so we want to build on that success and if we do it with one goal as one florida im confident were going to be able to get that done so its an honor for me to be able to introduce our ceo gino santorio from broward health so gino gino santorio in addition to the state effectively getting us some of the necessary drugs that have made a significant impact in the survivability such as remdesivir theyve also helped us in an area that is a significant need across the state which was staffing we currently in our system have employees that are a combination of respiratory therapists nurses and certified nursing assistants which have been able to help supplement our own staff to be able to ensure that we can effectuate a surge above and beyond what current numbers are today should we have needed them we would never as a safety net hospital turn away a patient safety nets in the state of florida represent about of the hospitals yet weve treated over of the covid hospitalized patients and a lot of the resources that enable us to do that have come not just from the state and internally but have come at a very rapid turnaround gino santorio inaudible nursing facilities have had testing of both the residents and the caregivers on a consistent basis you heard the speak about our covid only facilities that have been stood up that has been an absolute huge success factor in survivability of covid and maintaining a low mortality rate so very pleased to report that i do want to encourage and weve joined our hospital partners as well as additional healthcare partners in south florida to come together we launched a campaign called caringforsouthfloridaorg that encourages and really follows suit with the one florida campaign from the governors office to really encourage and maintain the diligence around social responsibility social distancing masking et cetera inaudible dave lacknauth they are on call for us night day weekends anytime they are there for us our infectious disease physicians as well same thing they are on call theyre on board theyre working with us to drive what i call that clinical bus in making sure we have the right therapies for supportive care around covid the care that we provide fo', 'r covid for our patients that are hospitalized is critical and important in this day and age what we find out is the one thing we understand is everything changes every day data comes out tomorrow that we didnt see today data is going to come out in two weeks that we dont know from tomorrow dave lacknauth they were able to ensure we got what we needed when we needed it to ensure our patients had the supplies and medication portfolio that they would need for our clinicians to then administer care again i just want to keep it brief with an overview of what were doing clinically to support our patients that come into broward health if you do come into broward health for covid or noncovid issues our clinical teams are here to support you and you will receive the best care that we can possibly give to you with the most up to date information im going to hand over now to dr lunches hes our chief medical officer for broward health medical center to expand on a little bit more dr lunches the patients outcomes of course are predicated on our knowledge of the ever evolving landscape of covid as you heard dave lacknauth talk about we do use things like remdesivir convalescent plasma is used so long as we can get it and youve heard really what we need the most though is for the community to help us help them and the way that they could do that is by adhering to the pivotal components of the governors platform where we protect the vulnerable where you wear your mask where you do hand hygiene and where you physically distance cheryl wilde i am cheryl wilde i represent nursing for the facilities in broward health i would just like to say that i very much support what my clinical partners have just said the care that were giving the patients is amazing the caregivers i cannot stand here without thanking them the caregivers the nursing teams the respiratory therapists everyone whos come out to really give everything that they have this last five months or so has been very challenging for them i cannot thank the and the state enough for the support that theyve given us the staffing and the nursing who have really just come out and help to support our system the care that were giving our patients again is top rate our outcomes have been very very good and im just very very thankful for all the support that we have received from the state at this point well thanks so much we really appreciate all the hard work i think the average member of the public understands that people in health care often have to work hard and i think that they assume that in a situation l', 'ike that thats even doubly but dealing with an infectious disease like this really is labor intensive because even if you guys have someone in a car accident they swab positive youve got to do all kinds of procedures to isolate to make sure that youre keeping it from spreading throughout your facility it requires a lot of folks to work a lot of hours work very hard obviously you have ppe and everything but none of that is foolproof so people are potentially exposing themselves as patients come in although i think the track record has been really good with our healthcare workers in terms of using that equipment its been a real challenge and i think that the folks really have stepped up done a great job we are happy to be able to provide some support and were going to continue to keep that support going for as long as you need it im encouraged about your trends i think that thats a really good sign we look at all these different things this number of tests or that but some of that is based on how many people youre testing whats your testing criteria when are the labs reporting all this but the people showing up at the emergency department or the people that are being admitted or discharged here thats just the reality of what the disease is doing and i think the fact that theyre either discharging people theyre generating a lot of positive outcomes compared to what you would have seen in february and march either in the united states or in other parts of the world thats really really encouraging and were obviously excited to be able to provide remdesivir work with the white house to do that and as other things come down the pike we want to continue to be helpful but we are here to help south florida we really appreciate its been a challenge for the whole state dont get me wrong the first kind of time we had south florida and then the rest of the state was relatively modest in terms of the prevalence this time i think everyone saw more prevalence but of course here in broward and miamidade youve seen the most and so i really appreciate how great everyones responded youve seen the most and so i really appreciate how great everyones responded with that im happy to take a question or two yes maam i got tested like two days ago so im not sure when that would have happened or whatnot so im tested regularly and i dont have or have not had any symptoms so the number of times ive been tested has been pretty significant and ive had my temperature checked probably a hundred times just in the last few months yes maam is that glenna oh hi this is for the lon', 'gterm care isolation centers okay yep well a couple of things one is the family should be notified if a family member is transferred to an isolation center i thought that that was being done but im going to look to see because they need to obviously if theres a positive case the nursing homes are required to notify the families with that but they should also do that so these isolation centers are following all the cdc guidelines they have negative pressure they have to be able to do that in order to get approved by ahca so as long as theyre following those rules its going to be safe and if somebody is covidpositive and is put there they are not allowed to be mixed if you do have a situation like that with the general population of course not that would defeat the whole purpose of doing the transfer in the first place because if were going to do that we could have just left them in the nursing facilities the nursing facilities we do have many just regular nursing facilities that have the ability to isolate we have plus most of them dont have that ability some do so if you have the ability to isolate and you have a positive test or two you can isolate the residents appropriately and obviously not allow that to get into the general public but for those which are the majority who do not have the capability of isolating theyre required to be transferred to a place that can be safely isolated sometimes thats hospitals and when we were in april and may we would see a lot of transfers but when the patient is not requiring hospitalization to have a covidonly nursing facility where they can safely isolate convalesce and then be discharged safely back is a really good tool but i think the families they need to be kept apprised on that so im going to talk to secretary mayhew and make sure that thats the case believe me thered be no reason to transfer anyone unless it was necessary for safety but i think as we found that when you have these outbreaks that run unchecked in a nursing facility you are going to see major clinical consequences for that in terms of hospitalizations and unfortunately in terms of a longterm care facility resident deaths yes sir so i havent talked to the white house but ive tried to say from the beginning well certainly over the last few months when it became apparent the number one source of outbreaks is in the home and so that becomes a specific challenge my house my wife and i i got young kids were not in the risk categories but youve got a lot of families in florida where youll have multi generational living or even if theyre ', 'not under the same roof particularly you look like a county like miamidade you just have a lot of family that live in the area and theyre getting together theyre doing what normal families do the risk and either if youre under the same roof the whole time or if youre in close contact is that those more vulnerable relatives whether its a parent a grandparent an uncle they then can be exposed by younger people who may not be visibly demonstrating symptoms and so i think its something that people should absolutely look at whether its the mask whether its isolation i think theres a lot of different ways but just to understand protecting our vulnerable part of that is if youre in those vulnerable groups you need to do what you can do to avoid crowds to protect yourself but everyone else also has a responsibility to govern themselves accordingly where theyre not providing any type of a danger to them but i would also say though the physical distancing avoiding the close contact in an enclosed environment that should not be put aside so youre going to do the mask in addition to that but just understand if youre in very close sustained contact particularly with some of those cloth masks you dont have a hundred percent protection of the droplets youre talking about it will intercept hopefully some hopefully most but certainly not all so people shouldnt have a false sense of security on that you still got to do the sanitation you still got to do the physical distancing so in terms of the education our primary policy is that parents should have a choice if they want to do distance learning because they dont want inperson instruction right now they should have the ability to do that but then for the many parents who really do believe that their kids need to be in the classroom we want that choice as well the department of education is working in conjunction with the department of health with districts on a districtbydistrict basis and they are also working with their local county health departments to be able to devise the best safety plans i think that theres a number of things that they may have in common but i also think that a plan in miamidade may look a little bit different than some of the other counties which may be more rural and may have less prevalence but id also say that we are happy to see singledigit positivity statewide for two days in a row we had been mired in we did have it go down to and then to see this decline i hope that that trend continues i think people have really been doing their part to make sure that it does thanks everybody']\n",
            "[['and new jersey port authority whos doing been doing an extraordinary job the port authority does among other things the administration of the airports building the new john f kennedy rebuilding jfk so hes been doing double duty and we have a great announcement today that we joined in this morning which im going to chat about in a moment todays day for those who are counting if youre not counting its still date number of hospitalizations what does that number mean it is a new low since we were in the midst of the battle so that is great news number of covid patients in icu also a new low since the height of the crisis number of intubations also a new low so thats great news number of lives lost a new low on the three day average three people passed away yesterday so this is really all great great news and i congratulate new yorkers because this is purely a result of the actions that theyve been taking the progress is even better than we expected remember when we started reopening all the experts said expect the infection rate to increase when the activity rate increases thats what youve seen all across the country thats what youve seen in other countries and thats what we expected here we then were talking about calibrating the increase and making sure it didnt go that high but it was supposed to go up after two two and a half months of reopening the numbers have actually gone down which nobody suggested and that is really to compliment new yorkers we started reopening may th thats where it was on the curve you call it a curve i call it a descent of the mountain we get to the same place we just have different metaphorical images but thats where the reopening started since the reopening the numbers continue to go down no expert predicted that so new yorkers are doing better than anyone else even expected cautious still well why shouldnt we be celebrating because look around thats why look at whats going on across the country look at those increases look at what were dealing with in terms of now states on the quarantine list and look at incidents of lack of compliance the numbers are a result of the actions and we have been disciplined and we have to stay disciplined in terms of enforcement local governments have to do a better job i dont know how else to say it were doing everything we can on the state side the sla and the state police are working double duty we have a problem with young people and lack of compliance we have a problem especially at bars and restaurants last night they did another violations they checked establishments over the weekend they checked establishments ', 'and did violations all this to say to the bars and restaurants follow the rules because if you dont follow the rules chances are likelihood is someones going to be there to watch and to check and thats the way it should be if youre following the rules fine if youre not following the rules if i were you i would be worried and thats the way it should be were seeing continued situations that are just not intelligent and local governments have to crack down on these whether theyre in new york city or long island or theyre in upstate new york how a charter boat could put together a crowd on deck and leave its just disrespectful its illegal it not only violates public health it violates common decency look at all the people you endangered what if one of those people on that cruise gets sick and dies what if the one of those people on that cruise get sick and goes home and gives it to a parent who dies i mean it is just really reckless rude irresponsible and illegal under the inaudible bridge apparently dozens of people partying we need better enforcement all across the state on the issue of schools i want to be clear we have school districts in this state the districts are putting in plans on how they will handle the reopening ill make a determination later this week on the infection rate whether or not were going to reopen schools but just because a district puts out a plan doesnt mean that if we reopen the school parents are going to come or teachers are going to come its not well the government said the schools are open now everybody must go its not going to happen that way im talking to parents i am telling you it is not going to happen that way they are not going to trust the school district this is an issue of public health just because the school district says you shouldnt worry about your childs public health thats not going to be enough not in this environment not when youre dealing with situations that everybody knows that nobody has the facts parents are going to want to understand the information for themselves ill tell you what theyre asking me ill tell you what theyre going to ask every school district how are you going to test how many tests are you going to take are you sure you have them lined up are you sure those are enough tests is it a representative sample how long is it going to take to turn around the tests is it two days four days seven days theyre informed parents theyre the most informed people on this issue probably in the country theyve lived through it theyre going to have questions this is not going to be the school district puts out a plan and then by ', 'fiat by dictatorship that is the plan you need the parents to be comfortable you need the teachers to be comfortable you need the children to show up at school and theres going to have to be a discussion you look at some of these plans theyre indecipherable even if you can understand the plan they raise questions and parents are going to need to talk it through i encourage every school district set up a discussion room now start explaining to the parents now have those conversations now you cant call people into a conference room but you can invite them onto a video chat or onto a chat room but they have questions and they need answers and time is short that should start now because the parents are going to make the decision nobodys going to tell them me whether or not i should send my child to school im going to make that determination and im going to want to make sure its an informed determination and im not going to trust just whats on some school districts plan im not going to do that and parents have to be comfortable and they should be comfortable because they are the ultimate decision makers here just because i say the infection rate is low thats not going to cause a parent to send the child back to school just because of the school district says we have a safe plan im telling you its not going to work they have to feel comfortable which means they have to be part of the process we have to have a dialogue i want to congratulate the port authority rick cotton who runs it chairman kevin otoole the saint nicholas greek church has been a long saga for new york was destroyed in it was supposed to be rebuilt there were fits and starts bureaucracy was slow this was slow but i was just with his eminence the archbishop and it is now being rebuilt it is magnificent it really is a beautiful structure it is the only church on part of the only church on part of it is going to be a bereavement center its not just a greek church its a universal center for reconciliation it is a spiritual place and weve been trying to get it done for a long time sometimes god works in funny ways that it is now being rebuilt at this moment all these years after why this moment maybe because god says he needs or wants a symbol of renewal and rebirth at this moment maybe it was gods way of saying to new yorkers yes this is a tough time yes weve been dealt a hard blow but we can rise up we can build back and we can build back better st nicholas is better than the church that was there before we didnt just rebuild st nicholas this is a vastly improved physical structure from what it was this is going to be a', ' national landmark st nicholas when its done and i think theres a symbolism there for all new yorkers were going to have to build back theres no doubt about it we dont even understand the extent of the economic damage that has been done and its going to be hard im telling you that but weve done it before well do it again and thats what st nicholas said to me today when i was there in terms of the national situation and i want to speak plain truth on this we said we have two threats we have the lack of compliance and we have the national situation the national situation is getting worse its not getting better that is a fact as i like to say its an inarguable fact you look at the numbers look at whats happening in florida look at california look at texas look at the numbers look at whats happening all across the midwest where youre seeing a dramatic rise look at what the white house is now saying where you entered a new phase of covid whats the new phase extensive spread oh thats the new phase what was the old phase if the new phase is extensive spread what was the old phase that was limited spread what we went through i mean its absurd its not a new phase it was entirely predictable it was the progression of a virus its exponential increase which is what a virus does one person affects two people two people infect four it is the exponential pyramid of viral spreads its not a new phase it was a mathematical equation that you just have to factor out you have medical experts who are now saying we should hit the reset button that the nation should shut down and start over that thats the only way to stop the virus thats what medical experts are saying hit the reset button shut down everything and start all over again thats a damning commentary on where we are hit the reset button just close all the states and start over look you want to start over you want to hit the reset button ill tell you how we hit the reset button in this country we start this time with the truth we do something different than was done in this country six months ago when this started start with the truth tell the american people the truth and it starts on a reset with the president of the united states telling the truth which he did not do six months ago and if you want to hit the reset button and you need to hit the reset button and i believe we need to hit the reset button then hit the reset button but do it honestly and it has to start with the president telling the american people the truth the truth is it was a mistake to deny covid it was a mistake to downplay covid it was a mistake to say its just the fl', 'u it was a mistake to say its gone by easter it was a mistake to say its going to magically disappear when it gets warm it was a mistake to say i see the light at the end of the tunnel it was a mistake to say yes were going to do testing but i dont think we need it those were all mistakes those were all untruths and they sent the wrong message to the american people because some people heard the president and believed him and if you believed him you wouldnt take covid seriously and if you didnt take covert seriously then you wouldnt take the precautions that people were saying you should take but thats what the president of the united states was saying six months ago the president of the united states said five months ago reopen the economy liberate the states liberate the economy his governors are slowwalking reopening theyre just playing politics thats what theyre doing theres no reason not to reopen the economy hurry up hurry up hurry up florida jumps texas jumps arizona jumps yes were just going to reopen the economy that was a mistake it was an untruth it denied the science it denied what theyre saying now the virus will spread if you do that tell the truth the truth is it was a mistake that when you saw what was going on in new york five months ago you didnt heed the warning it was a mistake when you saw the spike in new york you thought somehow those people were different and your people were immune your people arent immune new yorkers had no different immune system that made them more contagious to the virus it was a mistake to deny the reality that happened in new york that was broadcast across the country that was a mistake it was a mistake to see what we had to do here in new york the testing the hospital system the contact tracing the close down the phase reopening and pay no attention to it no attention to it six months later these states still dont have testing and contact tracing how can it be you had six months here in new york we had two weeks we were ambushed because the virus came from europe and nobody told us these other states at six months how did you not set up a testing operation how did you not expand the capacity of your hospital system how did you not locate additional staff how did you not locate additional ppe you had six months the reason they didnt because they were listening to the president there is no issue there is no problem it was a mistake tell them the truth the truth is covid is serious it is deadly serious and its deadly serious for all of us its not deadly serious for democrats its not deadly serious for blue states only covid kills re', 'publicans and covid affects red states it is deadly serious it was not a political issue and it shouldnt have been politicized this is not a political issue and it shouldnt have been politicized this is public health thats what this was and it should have never been turned into a political symbol which is what this president did start with the truth and the truth is an outbreak anywhere is an outbreak everywhere thats what we should have learned in china thats where we should have learned from mers and sars and ebola and swine flu and hn an outbreak anywhere is an outbreak everywhere and its still true and the truth is none of us are safe until all of us are safe that is the truth if we dont tell the truth on the reset covid will never end and it will ricochet across the country it will just bounce back and forth you see how its bouncing now its ricocheting its florida its texas its the midwest its california oh its back to new jersey is on the rise oh its back to massachusetts is on the rise it will continue this ricocheting across the country because thats what viruses do it will never end this was a colossal blunder how covid was handled by this federal government colossal blunder shame on all of you six months shame on all of you six months lives lost hit the reset button yes but the way the medical experts are talking about it it wont work it wont work unless you hit the reset button and you start with the truth because if the american people are continued lying to the confusion and the chaos and the denial will continue hit the reset button its called the truth its called the plain truth the american people are smart if the president actually tells them the truth and says i made a mistake hes not going to be telling them anything they dont know every american knows he made a mistake every american knows this was the worst government blunder in modern history not since the vietnam war have american sat in their living room to see the numbers on the tv screen every night saying what a mistake it was during the vietnam war every night you saw the death toll you saw the injury toll on tv every night theyve seen this virus increasing all across the country and the death toll going up you dont think they know it was a mistake then you dont know the american people they are smarter than you think trust the american people and if you dont trust them and you dont trust their intelligence and you dont trust their ability to handle the information then you shouldnt ask to be their leader i trust the people of new york i told them the truth i told them the facts i never sugar coated ', 'i never shielded i told them the truth so they knew what to do and they did it thats what we call being new york tough and smart and united and disciplined and loving they should try it in washington questions i dont know the status of the individual school plans sed is looking at that state health officials are looking at that my point is different my point is this is not going to be between a school district and the state or a school district and the state education department this is between the school district and the parents the ultimate decision maker are the parents and i dont hear enough about the parents concerns and the parents involvement and the dialogue with the parents its not going to be school district to the state school district to the sed yeah im not going to allow any school to open that i dont believe if we dont have a safe environment thats not going to happen and i think new yorkers know that by the way that doesnt mean that school is safe it doesnt mean the school theyre going to send their kid to is safe and by the way all they care about is the school that their kid is going to oh its very nice the infection rate is good in my region thats nice how about my kids school thats all i care about and just because you send me a form that says it has been determined that school is safe to return to no its not enough its not enough for me i want to review the plan i want to understand the plan i have questions that i want to ask theyre asking me the questions i mean theyre good questions the school district is going to test how many tests how many kids do you have how many tests is that a representative sample how long is it going to take you to get the test returns do you know where are you going to find these tests you dont have them now where are they going to come from all the information says the test results are coming back slower youre going to get them done faster how i mean these are smart people with good questions and youre talking about my childs health marcia were going to approve an infection rate that says from an infection rate point of view the environment is safe to open the school thats all im going to say i am not saying ps is safe in the city i dont even think the plan speaks to ps and thats what the teacher what the parents are going to want to talk about is ps well if there is not sed is supposed to review that and the state department of health and if it is clearly on its face not safe then it wont be approved but my point is marcia i dont care what any bureaucrat says i trust the parents more than anyone and i dont care if a school dis', 'trict says reopen if they dont have a good plan for reopening no kids are going to come and no teachers are going to come so then you have no reopening so youre talking to yourself well where you have a district with multiple schools they have to address the plan for every school now youd have to have a uniform plan you could have a uniform plan for every school every school will have of its students tested on a weekly basis that comes out to tests im getting those tests from quest lab theyre required theyre going to be there by the contract it says quest lab will do the tests the turnaround time will be two days if the child is positive within two days that child will be removed for hours you know youre going to need that level of specificity i havent seen the city plan i dont review the actual plans but if you dont have the details for each school then you dont have a plan because how can a parent make a decision and its not just new york city you know its any school district im talking to parents all across the state and the questions im giving you are verbatims from parents right theyre what you would ask theyre what i would ask and well we have a additional information no we dont ive been doing these briefings for a lot of days people know the questions about this issue were not talking about some normal government issue taxes budgets roads this is their life they know what theyre talking about great question and its the number one question any parent is going to ask what is the representative sample lets say the universe is million what does your health department say is a representative sample you need to test what percent of that million to be meaningful on what basis and then how do you do it thats why im saying the conversation is going to be all about the details pete it doesnt make sure this is done safelike it doesnt because i dont think theres anything unexpected there i dont think the indiana school district is unexpected i dont think that georgia camp is unexpected thats why we didnt open camps i dont think the israel experience with schools is unexpected we know this point we knew this six months ago we knew all of this six months ago thats why its so frustrating that were still talking about this at such a level of ignorance and denial and were so woefully unprepared i mean i was in savannah i was talking to the mayor of st petersburg we still dont know that we have to do tests and we dont have that set up but anyway you have a large congregation of people you put them in a place its the new rochelle superspreader its the new rochellesuper spreader our first w', 'eek one person goes to a congregation goes to a wedding ceremony infects dozens school is no different so i dont care what the building looks like it doesnt matter school church temple mosque cafeteria restaurant its all the same so is there the potential between now and the opening of school if you see things happening what you describe and you say i cannot in good conscience allow schools to open up for now pull the plug for now case closed it would take to one of two things either a the infection rate would have to go up where you knew you were dealing with a highly charged environment or two a particular school district wouldnt have an acceptable plan i believe the unacceptable plan is going to be determined more by the parents and the teachers we have million students lets say in new york city okay so you have roughly how many parents to million you have to million people looking at that plan theyre going to determine if its safe theyre going to blow the whistle and then if a school does not have a safe plan then we wouldnt allow it to open the problem is youre not dealing with an absolute its going to be a relative decision not opening schools is also highly highly problematic you know that you were affecting socialization issues for children you know that you may be subjecting some children to a dangerous situation at home you know you may be aggravating food insecurity that children cant eat you know that you will be aggravating the disparity between wealthier households and poorer households because remote learning is not an equalizer it is a separator it works better where you have two parents at home with a wealthier household that has technology et cetera so neither option is perfect it is a relative decision i dont know that anyone has looked at the plans some plans have not come in some plans are too top line to actually answer the questions because these are the questions if a plan doesnt answer these questions the plan is not sufficient so some plans are in that category i know theyre talking to districts many of the districts have said oh ill send more detail so we dont even really have the plans they sent in a top line and now they have to send in the actual details because the devil is in the details theres no top line here the top line is easy i can open the schools everybodys going to be safe im going to do testing im going to do cohorting have a nice day but i dont believe theyve gotten to the point where they have declined any program and i dont believe sed has even started really looking through them i dont run sed its a state agency everybody thinks im ', 'responsible im not the state education department is totally separate im not going to let washington off the hook they have to deliver they have to deliver we have federal representatives we have senators and we have congress people we pay them to pass a piece of legislation thats going to help new york and its simple if the legislation is not going to help new york you know what i say to them dont pass it it cant pass without you it cant pass without you dont pass a piece of legislation that doesnt restore new yorks funds if you pass a piece of legislation that requires new york to raise taxes raise a millionaires tax in this economic environment in new york city where were struggling we used to be worried millionaires tax people might leave no no no the burden shifted were trying to get people to come back were trying to get them to come back covid is under control were going to make progress helping the homeless were going to clean up the graffiti were going to fix crime on top of that you want to say and by the way when you come back you even get a big tax increase our population of the population pays of the taxes and theyre the most mobile people on the globe i literally talk to people all day long who are now in their hamptons house who also lived here or in their hudson valley house or in their connecticut weekend house and i say you got to come back when are you coming back well go to dinner ill buy you a drink come over ill cook theyre not coming back right now and you know what else theyre thinking if i stay there they pay a lower income tax because they dont pay the new york city surcharge so that would be a bad place if we had to go there senators congresspeople dont pass a bill that hurts new york again and by the way their argument is so easy the federal government caused the new york state problem it was the negligence of the federal government how did they not know the virus went from china to europe and came to new york how did they not know that department of homeland security cdc nih all these federal agencies all this taxpayer money nobody said oh the virus is in china in december maybe itll infect someone who gets on a plane nobody thought that december january february nobody thought in three months that the virus might be traveling after mers after sars which also happened in china from a wet market a poultry market and came to the united states nobody thought oh this might be like every other past viral transmission it was the federal negligence and now theyre not going to pay for the damage they did dont vote for the bill dont vote for the bill have a '], ['in the thereafter not only his operation warp speed accelerating the development of a vaccine were also directing a colossal industrial mobilization to ensure its rapid delivery nothings happened like this since the end of world war ii instead of the usual sequence of vaccine development testing and trials followed by production our strategy is to conduct these phases simultaneously so everything goes at one time were not waiting and waiting and waiting its all going at one time we have a system that has i think its unparalleled has never been done before but we suspect its going to work and work very well were massproducing all of the most promising vaccine candidates in advance so that on the day one that its approved it will be available to the american people immediately and well probably have a lot for a lot of other people throughout the world the world is suffering from this china virus another dimension of operation warp speed is our focus on therapeutics to treat the virus over including remdesivir which is having a tremendous impact you see that with mortality rates and other things statistically dexamethazone convalescent plasma and antibody treatments we have numerous treatments right now that are under study i think over the next couple of weeks we may actually have some very positive answers as to that on july th we announced a million agreement with regeneron to begin advanced manufacturing of its antibody treatment which is currently in ', 'late stage clinical trials late stage due to the medical advances weve already achieved and our increased knowledge in how to treat the virus the mortality rate for patients over the age of is lower than it was in april think of that and its lower than europe as a whole in the middle of april more than of all deaths in the united states were attributable to the china virus as the last week that number has dropped down as of last week its dropped down to under to decrease the turnaround times for testing the first two laboratories have been approved to provide pooled testing very important in other words samples from multiple patients are processed together they are pooled now pool testing will reduce turnaround times by more than substantially more than last week our centers for medicare and medicaid services began distributing rapid point of care diagnostic test instruments to all of the nursing homes in the united states focusing on the areas of greatest need which is our elderly and our nursing homes what weve already sent includes testing instruments to nursing homes for rapid point of care tests its a tremendous amount thats youll get your response and answer from five to minutes over the next three weeks nursing homes will receive an additional point of care tests think of that the united states has conducted over million tests thats more than all of europe put together times two nobodys even close and as countries go it is as an example india is ', 'up to million tests were going to be very shortly at million tests india has billion people through our relentless efforts weve completely rebuilt our stockpile which the previous administration depleted and did not refill the cupboards were bare i say it often in total weve now distributed nearly masks million surgical masks million face yields and much much more in addition to that ventilators the most difficult thing of all we are now building thousands a month and well distribute them we have all we need in our country but to other countries that are in desperate need other countries are having a tremendously difficult time with the virus last week fema sent additional personnel protective equipment to over nursing homes including pairs of protective eyewear million masks million pairs of gloves and million gowns its a lot over the weekend cases in florida texas and arizona held steady and are now heading down in arizona theyre heading very substantially down and rapidly weve been constant and in constant communication with the states and are surging them resources when requested they largely had what they needed but anything they need we send them immediately we are totally full we have everything we need we get it to the states immediately we deal with the governors the relationship with the governors has been very good these states are not out of the woods but rigorous compliance with guidelines should allow them to turn the corner and very very ', 'quickly we are working with every and health commissioner across the country to bring a complete individualized analysis to each state as well as tailored recommendation states are different my administration is also closely monitoring the surging caseload in latin america which is now the region in the world with the most active reported infections by far due to the relative scarcity of testing in latin america however the regions reported number of cases is also likely to be dramatically undercut or undercounted i can say thats probably true throughout the entire world we report our cases most of the world doesnt they either dont do testing therefore they have very few cases even though people are sick or they just dont report given the reality of what we just said were focusing aggressively on the texas border and countries that we think have to be watched very very carefully because you have some very very highlyinfected countries outside of our borders ive spoken with abbott terrific gentlemen and i can report that over federal personnel are on the ground in texas weve given them a tremendous amount of extra help including doctors nurses frontline people weve supplied texas with more than million gloves goggles surgical gowns million surgical masks million n respirators and half a million kn masks beginning this week texas hospitals will receive cases of remdesivir which has proven very effective enough to treat patients in addition to the cross bo', 'rder spread the stage of the pandemic is being fueled by younger americans who generally have little risk of being seriously harmed by the disease but can spread the disease we need all americans to be conscious about their actions and to exercise extreme vigilance i trust all americans to do the right thing but we strongly advise everyone to especially especially focus on maintaining a social distance maintaining rigorous hygiene avoid large gatherings and crowded indoor bars and wear masks when appropriate we also strongly urge citizens to take extra precautions to shield those at highest risk which are in most cases in many cases the elderly especially the elderly with medical problems such as heart or diabetes but you want to shield them and you want to guard them and you want to protect them from the virus especially especially those that are really targeted almost targeted you could say by this horrible horrible plague this horrible epidemic pandemic america will develop a vaccine very soon and we will defeat the virus we will have it delivered in record time as our visit here demonstrates i want to thank all of the people and representatives from the great state of north carolina is a great place its a phenomenal place weve had so many great meetings and such a great time i want to drive into the drive and tenacity of your representatives and your politicians has been incredible when they call im there when they call most of them many of them are', ' sitting here right now i will always answer their call thank you very much i appreciate you being here with us and lets get onto a few questions tremendous progress has been made and its been made rapidly and its been made in areas that nothing like that has taken place before please thank you very much thank you thank you well i think so but there would be not that same kind of hope if we werent doing so well where before just before i left the white house in the oval office we had a meeting with our doctors scientists some others and theyre making tremendous progress with respect to therapeutics i can tell you therapeutically i think over the next couple of weeks well have some really very good things to say were just having great answers it is about that its also the vaccine that we discussed today at even greater length is just coming along really well its not just one company its many companies have had tremendous progress thatll be announced over the next very short period well i heard very positive things but by the end of the year we think were in very good shape to be doing that by the end of this year were going to in terms of the vaccine i think in terms of therapeutics even sooner than that therapeutics meaning you go and you give somebody whether its transfusion or shots or whatever it may be and they heal and they heal quickly weve had tremendous progress we already have if you look at remdesivir and you look at some of the other things b', 'ut well have some announcements on that over the next two weeks yeah it is hope but its only hope because weve gotten such incredible results scientifically yeah we dont talk about what we discussed but we had plenty of discussion and i think it was very productive please i dont think so i think the recovery has been very strong weve set record job numbers weve set record numbers whether its a pure v or a little bit less than that i think its going to be very good if therapeutically we come up with some answers very quickly which i think we will then youre going to have a tremendous recovery likewise with the vaccines if you do that by the end of the year thats ahead of schedule substantially ahead of schedule and its ahead of anything thats ever taken place in terms of vaccines before i think if those things happen if just one of those events happen youll go right back into that v and i think youre probably in the v anyway i really do believe a lot of the governors should be opening up states that theyre not opening well see what happens with them but a lot will have to do with the fact that therapeutically i think youre going to have some great answers vaccinewise likewise yeah please go ahead in the back well were actually coming to north carolina as you know were having a very major i guess that would be the nomination night thats a monday thatll be monday theyre going to be here and the rest well do in a different form we could have done it many di', 'fferent ways but i think we did the right thing and im really happy that were going to be having a piece of it at least in a very important piece in north carolina yes please go ahead i think the poll numbers are very good the poll numbers we have are very good were leading in north carolina were leading in pennsylvania were leading in arizona our numbers were leading in arizona were leading nicely in florida i think our poll numbers are very good were leading substantially in georgia i mean we get a lot of suppression polls we get a lot of fake polls just like we have fake news i mean its a terrible thing when you look at it but i had the same thing four years ago i was losing everywhere i had poll numbers where i wasnt going to win any state i ended up winning every one of them the swing states i wasnt going to win any of them and i want all of them i have the same thing this year this year they have it even closer they have it closer but its the same suppressiontype polls we have polls that show me leading in almost every swing state and substantially in other states by even more than i won in when you look at florida as an example you have thousands of boats out of the ocean out on the intercoastal you look at other states where likewise you have thousands of boats and their all waving the sign trumppence sign and theyre so proud thousands and thousands you have seen it where you have bikers for with lines that are miles long on highways going along', ' on weekends i think theres more spirit now than theres ever been for my campaign that includes where obviously there was great enthusiasm great spirit we had great spirit i think theres more today because what weve done nobodys ever done before nobody has ever rebuilt the military cut taxes the most in our history created the greatest economy weve ever had cut regulations at a level that nobodys ever done all of these different things the va we got va choice we got va everything for the va right now they had a approval rating in a recent poll i was just speaking to the secretary in the va thats never happened before i think when people see all that weve done even space force we created a force that actual army navy air force marines right its pretty amazing coast guard now space force that hasnt happened in years what weve done working with some of those warriors over there by the way but what weve done has never been done if you look at alaska with anwr perhaps the biggest drilling site in the world even ronald reagan and bush and clinton everybody wanted to get it done i got it done anwr in alaska probably or possibly the biggest drilling site in the world now what weve done has been incredible recently it looked like the energy business was going to be a catastrophe we were number one in the world and then we had the pandemic and nobody was using energy nobody was driving in automobiles no gasoline by the way gasoline prices for everyone a very very', ' low in many cases less than thats pretty incredible i saved the energy business i got russia and i got saudi arabia on the phone and they cut way back and were now at and plus a barrel were saving tens of millions of jobs in energy were the number one in energy in the world with all that weve done we made and brought this country to the greatest point in its history we never had an economy like we had prior to the china plague or china virus coming in we never had numbers like it we are going to have them again and everyone knows im going to rebuild it i had to close it up we saved millions of lives by closing it if we didnt close i you would have seen numbers that would have been times what you have right now one death is too much but it would have been to times maybe more than that what you have we closed this greatest economy ever far bigger than china better than china china was having by the way the worst year they had in years tariffs they paid us tens of billions of dollars the worst year theyve had think of it in years we were having the best year weve ever had i had to close it and now were reopening it next year well be stronger itll be the strongest year so far itll be better even than last year okay thank you very much ill be heading back ill see you back at the white house thank you very much were going to take an additional tour of the facility with your great leaders thank you very much to the people of north carolina we love being here '], ['good afternoon everyone thank you for joining us i am joined today by superintendent of public instruction kathy hoffman thank you for being here superintendent of course the leader of arizonas department of health services dr cara christ thank you for being here dr christ and the gentleman who leads our national guard and dema effort general mcguire thanks for being here i want to take everybody through the latest information around coronavirus in arizona and then were going to have an education update for you as well i want to begin by just saying thank you once again i want to say thank you to the healthcare workers our doctors our nurses our healthcare professionals everybody thats on the frontline we know how hard youre inaudible and were incredibly grateful for what youre doing in protecting arizonans and protecting their lives and also to the business leaders and to the workforce in arizona this has been a challenging time for everyone weve been having a lot of discussions with business leaders and leaders of employer organizations so we could make the best possible decisions and to all arizonans this is affecting everyone in our state were in this together weve asked you to do a lot and were going to share with you the results of where arizona is today and it wouldnt be happening without your partnership and participation i want to remind everyone as i have over the last several weeks that you are safer at home regardless of the information im going to be able to share today coronavirus is with us today and going forward its highly contagious and its in every part of our state and you really help arizona when you are at home at this point in the pandemic todays numbers are total covid cases this week we have average cases and my heart prayers and thoughts go out to the arizona families who have lost a loved one to the coronavirus all people in arizona have been affected by covid none more so than these families and you are in our thoughts and our actions every day in terms of arizonas trend today our major metrics are headed in the right directions covidlike illness in emergency room has a downward trend covid patient icu and hospital bed use has a downward trend and the percentage of positive tests in arizona has a downward trend lets run through the numbers blue line is covidlike illness in arizona the gold line is influenzalike if you look at the covidlike the blue line you can see the two legs over the last two weeks are a dramatic drop down from to thats in just two weeks that much of a decrease thank you to arizonans for participating in this improvement our covid cases by day if you can see on the chart our cases began to ramp up in june and escalated through july theyre headed in the other direction so for several weeks we had a trend going in the right direction now were seeing some im sorry in the beginning of june we had a trend headed in the wrong direction over the last couple weeks you see the beginnings of a trend in the right direction we need to continue that headed in the right direction in terms of lessening our cases by day and most specifically in terms of lowering our positivity rate in arizona the blue mountain data graph is the number of tests in arizona the gold line is our percentage positivity weve been as high as in this last week a downward trend of its the right direction its still too high but it is headed in the right direction lets look at our hospital bed capacity this does not include the additional surge beds in our preparation for a potential worst case scenario but what you see here is capacity the gold is the covidlike illness or the patients that do have covid inside our hospitals if you look at the course of the last six weeks youll see an increase a flattening and the beginnings of a slight decrease youll see the same thing here with our icu beds it does not include the surge capacity beds that we had but for the patients that have covid youve seen an increase a flattening and the beginning of a slight decrease youll see the same trend here for ventilators around covid our testing by day the blue line is pcr test the orange is serology we are over one million total tests in the state of arizona with many more on the way i want to thank dr crow for the saliva test that asu has innovated and will be bringing to market dr robbins for his leadership on the serology test we do have some issues around demand for our testing we have tests available and we want people to take advantage of that were going to be talking about that a little bit later in the presentation lets talk about the recent actions that weve taken in arizona to slow the spread of this virus weve basically been prohibiting large gatherings i want to thank our mayors and county superintendents we have nearly of our state with local mask ordinances they make a real difference weve paused operations on gyms bars nightclubs water parks and tubing superintendent hoffman and i delayed the first day of school and weve reduced restaurant ca', 'pacity in arizona so lets look at how that has affected our results nearly three plus weeks ago i introduced this number the r number into our discussions this is the number that represents the average number of people who become infected by an infectious person when this number was introduced on june arizona was at meaning for every infected person more than one person was being infected over the last three weeks arizona has moved that number basis points in the right direction our r in arizona today is beneath one and its been beneath one since july so i want to thank you that couldnt happen without the participation of the citizens of arizona people are listening to the safer at home instruction theyre limiting mobility and it is resulting in positive numbers and direction for our state this is the new york times showing daily cases per individuals in the state it tracks hot spots in arizona if you can see from the day trend in many parts of our state and specifically in the most populous parts of our state were seeing a decline but were not seeing a decline everywhere so id ask you to continue to stay vigilant to know no matter whether youre in phoenix tucson or a rural area the virus is contagious and if we dont do the things we should be doing it can begin to more rapidly spread these are the newly reported cases by day in arizona according to the times you can see what a tough june the state of arizona had how it began to flatten with some of the mitigation measures we put forward several weeks ago and now we are seeing a decline in cases and we need to continue to see that now arizonas increase in cases begins in june our country had a flat june their escalation has been in july thats where weve seen our downturn i said last week that for weeks and weeks arizona was on this page every time i looked this is where new cases are increasing in our nation today theres states and territories where new cases are increasing last week for the first time we moved to where new cases are mostly the same and this week for the first week were one of two states in the country whee new cases are decreasing thats where we prefer to stay and thats where some of the actions that people are taking in the mitigation can keep us i hear the folks that dont want to hear from the new york times and dont want to hear what they have to say so if the new york times isnt good enough for you take it from msnbc they also show a decrease for cases in the state of arizona and for folks who dont want to hear from mainstream media outlets take it from the gold standard of excellence in public health internationally johns hopkins university of medicine to my eye arizona is the greenest state in the nation that is a downward trend over the previous three days and weve been there now for the last two times that we visited thats where we would like to stay is with a downward trend this is the covid tracking project i think they do a very good job of simplifying things they also let you go to a graph and whether you want to see it by state region nation or country you can customize it this is arizonas daily case count in red and our hospitalizations in blue you can see very simply that weve hit a peak and weve begun to head in the right direction lets continue that so that we dont have another peak its not unusual after we finish the presentation and turn it over for questions of someone to ask every now and again how do we trust the numbers that arizona is presenting first i want you to know that the covid tracking project gives arizona an a for our data information and thats the arizona department of health services thats azhealthgov so i know arizonans can deal with the truth we just want to make sure that you have the facts at the end of this press conference now lets talk about arizonas new normal and what we see for the foreseeable future we have been in the unhappy but necessary business of breaking up large adult gatherings thats why youve seen the businesses and venues here not operating or not operating in any of the traditional senses with people and fans and congregations and thats where were going to be for some time so today were going to continue to press on with the strategies that are working in arizona and continue them so todays announcements around mitigation are that the closure will be extended for gyms bars nightclubs water parks and tubing now people ask how do we come up with these venues for closure and i want you to know this is the direct recommendation from the centers for disease control so when you say your decisions are going to be guided by public health and not politics or whats popular you listen to public health and the recommendation for these venues is closure thats where we are at this time so theres no victory lap today theres no celebration we cannot let up we need to continue to be vigilant every day in the state of arizona to continue pressing and to make sure that we stay focused on the fundamentals so no victory lap no celebratio', 'n only continued physical distancing washing your hands and remembering that youre safer at home in addition to that one of the things that you can do that will make the biggest difference of course is wearing a mask and i want to thank arizonans from all over the state ive been sent pictures i know the pictures that oftentimes make the media are the ones that are outliers but i know people all over our state and especially in large crowds and when they havent been able to socially distance are more often than not choosing to wear a mask and i want to thank you for doing that we want to make sure that everybody that needs a mask has access to a mask we want to make sure that masks are there for vulnerable arizonans we introduced this last week at the press conference and were proud to partner with hanes to provide free cloth masks to arizonas most vulnerable residents and to prevent the spread of covid weve had over mask orders that have been received and theyre shipping now thank you for the order and thank you for wearing your mask i also have worked very hard with local leaders influencers and decision makers from around the state to make sure masks are seen as a good idea and something youre doing so that we can protect lives in arizona and protect our livelihoods i want to thank the leaders in the advertising industry inaudible high noon off madison urias lt rr and hma public relations we brought them together we challenged them to help us make wearing masks more ubiquitous and prevalent pull the politics out of it and make it part of what we need to do to get the pandemic behind us and we think that theyve done some good work and theres going to be an ad campaign were going to be advocating and resourcing this campaign statewide were grateful for their work and the campaigns going to be called tougher than covid were going to take a look at the couple of the spots now so hopefully this will play through the viewership in the conference in both english and spanish theyre going to be on tvs billboards and social media and once again i want to thank our team of marketing professionals for donating their time and giving us a really excellent effort and were looking forward to getting these on the air and on a billboard close to you theres another billboard as well go ahead tell me my mask looks weak i think theres theres more to follow so i want to switch gears now if we can to public k education something thats very topical and important in arizona i want to thank superintendent of public instruction kathy hoffman for being a partner and a leader and for prioritizing arizona children and safe and successful education in our state i also want to thank representative michelle udall and senator sylvia allen for their effort and input into the plan that were going to present going forward and with that i want to turn it over to superintendent kathy hoffman superintendent kathy hoffman thats why i am proud to join here today to outline additional clarity and guidance around the start of the next school year including developing benchmarks based on public health data that schools will use to determine the start of inperson instruction a dedication to fully fund distance learning flexibility and clarity around onsite learning requirements for vulnerable students continuity of pay for all educators and critical policies that support safety and student learning each of those pieces are extremely complex and have taken time and partnership to work through kathy hoffman while doing what they do best educating our students i have said before that protecting our school communities is a statewide effort i want to thank the members of our congressional delegation who have reached out to offer their advocacy for critical additional funding for schools and any upcoming relief packages i also want to thank the arizonans who have taken this pandemic seriously who have made sacrifices worn masks to protect themselves and their neighbors physically distanced and stayed home whenever possible covid has impacted all of us it has impacted my family my staff and my friends my brother living in italy was one of the first there to contract covid in february when there were still many unknowns and thankfully he made a full recovery my husband a physician in residency at phoenix childrens hospital faces risks in his job every day kathy hoffman chinles high school building is much more than a set of classrooms it is a community gathering space it is a space to build the skills minds and hearts of the next generation this is why i take so seriously the opportunity for schools to safely reopen their facilities it is the reason why i call on arizonans to mask up physically distance and stay home whenever they are able but i want to be clear that teaching and learning will happen no matter what the next school year looks like in your community i am thrilled to join here today to share our guarantees on how we will support schools in providing safe instruction and critical ', 'services during this next academic year thank you thanks very much superintendent so lets run through the plan for the next school year arizona will be open for learning and our priorities are going to be public health and safety were going to make data driven decisions there will be parental choice options for families in different situations flexibility to our school leaders and recognizing that the achievement gap and the digital divide are real and do everything we can to reduce and eliminate it and viewing our schools as our most essential service we provide as we move forward now i also want to thank all the leaders influencers and decision makers superintendents and the superintendent this plan was informed by your input well much of the public discussion has been focused on a date certain the focus needs to be on ensuring that arizona students have a successful academic year the goal is to provide our students with rigorous instruction and consistency in learning while prioritizing their health and safety this is the greatest challenge to public education in our lifetimes and arizona has the opportunity to lead the nation and that superintendent hoffman and my goal to make arizona a model state in this situation providing the best learning experience to kids in the safest environment during this crisis so days of instruction or equivalent hours will be required this year there will be options for inperson and distance learning and there will be teacher led distance learning that must begin by the first date of the academic school year children deserve a safe learning environment this includes kids and especially kids enrolled in free and reduced lunch programs special education students english language learners and foster kids so our schools must provide free onsite learning and support services while implementing healthy and safe protocols in the required onsite learning our decisions will be datadriven with maximum flexibility to local school leaders recognizing they need public health data to make decisions the arizona department of health services will develop and release public health benchmarks for the safe return of inperson teacher led classroom instruction local school leaders will make the determination and consider these recommendations face coverings schools will develop an implement face covering policies all adults will have a face covering on inside a school there will be exceptions for students when they can socially distance outside in playground settings breaks for students to take their masks off in a safe environment and other exceptions outlined by the centers for disease control in terms of resources we will bring in an additional additional investment in k education from the federal cares act in terms of million in grant dollars to schools this will ensure budget stability recognize additional costs inperson learning well bring to districts in the school year and closing the achievement gap this has been pointed out by many leaders in k education how real this was how it was amplified last year i want to thank dr chad gaston of phoenix unified for pointing this out in our last visit million to expand broadband million to bring in support for high need schools six million for the teachers academy a million dollars in micro grants to support innovative programs a million dollars for the school of the deaf and blind for leadership development for tutoring kids from teach for america so if you have questions or you want to see more on this you can go to your schools website for specifics to your superintendents this also be up on the superintendents website along with the governors website with more to follow learning starts now and when you want to see the specifics around now thats where you go to your local website switching gears again around getting tested talking about the coronavirus we know people want to get tested we have prioritized essential workers symptomatic and sick folks today we have tests available this is cdc surge testing these sites have been up and running since friday to date the wait times have been minimal and unfortunately the demand has been low if you look in maryvale our task capacity had of the test thats been administered and in south phoenix its been less so we want more to get tested at the sites its completely free theres no id required centrally located in the valley and youll have the results between and hours if you need more specific information go to azhealthgovsurgetesting and with that i want to turn it over to dr cara christ for a public health update dr christ dr cara christ so to talk about expanding testing a little bit more asu will be expanding their saliva based testing sites these are the free sites that they collect at they will continue to operate out of the west valley we will be adding sites in pima county coconino county and la paz county and then we have been working with additional providers to expand testing or to expand their capacity and that includes embr', 'y womens health cvs pharmacies the federally qualified health centers will be receiving grants to provide testing at their centers were working with a quality health to expand their testing in partnership with clpc as well as banner has expanded the number of tests that they can perform and they do have sites that are available dr cara christ thats the time from the collect to the time that they report get that result obviously since is an average we do know that there are days that are longer were getting a lot of questions about the viability of the samples and how long that they can be stored so they can be refrigerated for several days between three and five days depending on what type of media they are in and how they are collected they can be frozen at your regular freezer temperature so minus degrees for a week if you put them at minus or minus which we refer to as a deep freeze they can be frozen indefinitely and rewarmed and then tested the long turnaround times like i said do impact public health because we want to be able to connect with the people we want to give them the instructions on how to prevent transmitting covid to others and we want to get in touch with their contacts so that we can break that transmission chain dr cara christ so to talk about a couple of the initiatives that we announced the last week on our hospital resources we have implemented the staffing initiative we were able to secure that contract with vizient we have placed a request for staff to be allocated to hospitals in every region of the state we are prioritizing rural hospitals that have high transfer to our metropolitan high acuity hospitals and then were prioritizing our large hospitals that receive a number of those transfers staffing at some of those sites starts this week thank you very much dr christ thank you to your team i know how hard theyve been working at the department of health services and with that i want to turn it over to major general mick mcguire to give us an update on all the good work that dema is doing thanks so much general mcguire and thanks for all the good work that all the people at dema are doing and the brave women and men of the national guard as well they have been helpful at every turn and all of arizona is grateful so our plan of action moving forward is that were going to continue to take a responsible approach the decisions from my office will be guided by public health were going to ramp up the testing to identify infection in arizona you can see the investment around increasing lab capacity and the additional collection sites we want to provide relief to health officials and contact tracing to contain the spread and well measure the efficacy of our mitigation strategies metrics to watch weve had a downward trending cases but we are going to continue to focus on additional testing so with that there may be more cases on a horizon please lets focus on the percent positivity thats a number that we want to drive down were in a position today where we have capacity where people that are curious can get a test and we want to encourage you to get a test and schedule a test you can go to azhealthgov for more information also that mobility and rnaught number is something we want to keep below one if you make good decisions and are responsible stay safer at home thats helpful there and of course we want to make certain as we have the entire time and this is why again i want to say thank you to our doctors and nurses and health care professional and hospital leaders we have had capacity in arizona weve been able to bring capacity to arizona and our commitment is we will maintain capacity in the state of arizona so the next steps are wear a mask wash your hands physically distance and when you can stay home please wear the mask the virus is widespread and remember youre safer at home and with that well open it up for questions patrick peter good afternoon dr christ two weeks ago you were on our air on ktar saying you were looking for positivity rate or less of course to possibly reopen the schools i dont know were away from a date specific target at this point does that number still stand with you would that still be helpful to encourage districts or to show districts that it might be safe to resume in classroom learning peter still not looking for a specific number then i guess is like you said its a mixture of things peter very good and there was a piece of legislation moving through the house that had got approved regarding protecting businesses and other entities from lawsuits related to covid it never made it out of the senate would you consider calling a special session on this topic and perhaps some others related to it theres discussion right now at the federal level around this limiting of liability that may satisfy what the desire of the house and senate were in arizona i want to see where that package comes together before wed make a decision around that next step yeah we want to see what the feds are going to do t', 'heyre going to do something and its going to be likely this next week and then well have a better line of sight as to what might be needed in arizona we provided input from the national governors association on that and i sent a letter to our delegation so i think people can see whats important to me and i think to the state of arizona similarly i wanted to ask about congress has not extended yet the in additional unemployment benefits that a lot of arizonans are depending on and some of the reports weve seen have indicated that they might extend those benefits partially so cut to or are you considering anything at a state level like raising the benefit cap from a week or increasing the earned income disallowance to alleviate that burden on arizonas if that becomes the case so well of course were working with our delegation we sent a letter to our delegation shared widely with congress earlier this week the benefits go through this week we are in right now we know that congress never gets anything done until the last minute so anything thats going to come from the state would come after we have a better idea of whats happening there but where arizona has been able to navigate through this in terms of putting our safety net out making sure no one has fallen through the cracks through a lot of displacement was a partnership with our federal government in doing that well need that to continue to do that i want to see what congress is going to do and theyre going to do something this week i want to say i continue to want a public process a public process wasnt available and the legislature was not in session the decision was basically left to the department of administration decision was basically left to the department of administration can i finish the answer please can i finish the answer okay is it my turn the daughters of the confederacy is the organization that gifted the memorial to the state they wrote a letter to the state and asked for it back so it could be repaired they would like to put it in a separate location not on public property they were the individuals that gifted it to the state they asked for it back we granted their wish no there wasnt a public process available speaker so i wanted to get some more clarification about the schools coming back to sessions you mentioned there was a require onsite learning part of your presentation with the days as well what will that mean exactly with schools that choose to do completely online learning for the semester at least superintendent kathy hoffman some of the clarification that we provide through this new executive order is for example that a district doesnt have to have that at every school it could be one school per district that provides that onsite learning it could also be through a community partner like the boys and girls club has stepped up and said that theyre willing and eager enthusiastic to help serve students as well we wanted to make that really clear that the intent behind that requirement was to make sure that kids who really need it have a safe place to go kathy hoffman do you want me to start it and then kathy hoffman okay ill start in the executive order the department of education will be working with the department of health services and our county health offices to develop this framework by august it could be even sooner but we wanted to give all of us some time to be looking at different benchmarks and data points and come to consensus of that and then the idea is for our local school leaders like school governing boards and superintendents to have a framework to use and to be working in conjunction in close collaboration with their county health departments dr cara christ well be taking a look and reviewing what other states are using as benchmarks as well as making sure that theyre consistent with the centers for disease control and the white house task force we will be bringing that together the teams already started on that speaker billy next so billy i appreciate the question and i remain hopeful and optimistic as well at the same time ive got to deal with the facts that are in front of us i would welcome the challenge of helping educate arizonans as to why this vaccine would make our lives safer and healthier if and when its ready i think we all know what a long shot any vaccine like this is weve got the smartest most innovative medical professionals in the world in our nation but if that is something that we would have available to us thats something that i think youd see a full court press across the board to make certain that the maximum amount of our people were able to have the immunity to this virus kathy hoffman in terms of reporting our schools still have to follow hipaa requirements and things like that so we have been working closely with the department of health services in developing the department of health services has been developing protocols for our school leaders so they know exactly what steps to take when there is a positive case in t', 'he school community whether its a student or a teacher or staff dr cara christ they are working on those protocols there usually does require notification if there is a disease in a classroom that could be spread so well be working on that as part of the guidelines speaker inaudible nicole and then ali inaudible nicole i didnt say that things were positive i said these are the facts these are the data metrics that we have that theres no victory laps that theres no celebration that well continue to be vigilant and part of the reason that i show other independent and sometimes adversarial sources is because of exactly what youre asking right now everything that is put up here is informed by the arizona department of health services which from the covid tracking project has an a for its data i present the facts we are testing we have over a million tests that have been conducted in arizona our cases are going down by our data and by independent sources data our cases are going down now there is a backlog that is also a fact the private labs have been swamped and we are in a bit of a dilemma one is dr christ is going to talk about the efforts and the resources were providing to the private labs so that we get those facts and that they go into the positivity rate and then the other issue that we have is we dont have the demand for the tests we have several weeks where the demand is off the charts and cars are parked around the block today we have two sites that are operating between am and pm theyre wide open you dont need an appointment and no ones going through them so were encouraging people to get a test thats a test where youll get a result much more quickly and if you want to talk about the backlog at sonora quest id be grateful lets answer the question nicole okay well testing has and we would like to see nothing more than our positivity decrease so we are very eager to get those samples run thats accurate nicole like i said theres that demand superintendent im working with the subject matter professionals the experts and across the aisle and ill continue to do it ali good afternoon everyone three questions ones really simple how does any of this affect private or religious schools does any of this affect any of them not directly it indirectly oftentimes or at least in past scenarios theyve looked to state guidelines and guidance to inform their decisions but they have options we are following the public health and the directive or recommendation around a closure directive is much different than limiting in terms of occupancy at least in discussions with the leaders on the task force in washington dc the objective around those numbers is social distancing and you can see some of the issues that weve had here in arizona and some of the other western states including california and texas their climates are different than ours their options for some of their venues are unique to ours our guidance has been so that we can keep the social and physical distancing and like i said weve seen the numbers going in the right direction we continue to monitor it but we have options if we need to change im going to stay with the policy that ive had through this i want to see a public process when the legislature comes back well have the opportunity to put a public process forward no i dont want to kick the can down the road im focused on coronavirus right now this is a question that youve been asking me for well over a year and ive stayed to the same policy that i am not unilaterally going to make decisions on monuments and memorials there should be a public process speaker crosstalk were going to go with angela gonzales from phoenix business journal angela go ahead you might need to unmute yourself there angela we cant hear you speaker yes we can yes ill answer the resource question and let the superintendent as well the idea is that we want to fully fund out schools our teachers and our educators we also know theres been additional funding necessary so were working with cares acts dollars flexible funds and schools that follow the guidelines that we are presenting are going to have access to these funds and i also know at least as i was coming into this press conference i saw discussion around additional funding from congress as well so thats a possibility and if you want to talk about some of the guidelines and dr christ on the public health side of things thank you angela kathy hoffman there could be scenarios in the future where a school could open for inperson instruction and then if there happens to be another outbreak in that area they may need to close again so that is a possibility and that was actually included in part of our roadmap for reopening schools that we outlined different types of recommendations for different scenarios and thats one of the scenarios that we accounted for kathy hoffman our local governing boards have the authority to make that decision i would expect it would be the local governing boards making a decision in conjuncti', 'on with their local county health offices jj cooper thanks were coming up on the end of summer vacation and were just hearing that its going to be another two weeks or so before we get the metrics that schools can use to make these decisions why arent those available now or sooner given that weve known this problem was coming for as long as its been out there and then given the extreme delays in testing and measuring whats going on in the community how confident are you that those metrics will have reliable accurate uptodate data for the school districts to use thanks jj and i think its a fair question theres a framework that already exists things have changed quite a bit in the last four weeks i think weve been able to see that when we first had our meeting with the superintendents after the end of last school year all of the preparations were about going back into school in the traditional setting through the course of the discussions weve really found that weve got a very large constituency that no matter what in this setting and i mean no matter what even back in the beginning they dont feel comfortable or feel safe and likely do not want to go back into schools until theres a vaccine we also have a very large constituency that is ready to go back into school in person tomorrow and not concerned about anything thats in front of us and then we also have a very large constituency that has nowhere else to go except to the school their parent may be one of our frontline healthcare workers inside the hospital and they have to go to work so were trying to enhance the guidance to answer all the questions just like some of the questions that we face today around what if and what happens and what if this scenario happens in a school what if a student what if a teacher what if a classroom what a cohort you can really go down one after another were letting the subject matter experts from public instruction and the department of health services along with the centers for disease control do that what we laid out for you today was that were going to have a safe and successful school year in the state of arizona with flexibility ample resources and there will be hybrid options available arizona has always been a state thats respected parental choice and i want to really hand it not only to our leaders and our superintendents and our teachers but i think as much as i wish we didnt have to deal with what happened in the spring i think our state had a leap frog forward in terms of innovations and teachers that have embraced distance learning and chad guston in our last meeting said phoenix union and where it is right now has set an objective at least for the first quarter or first semester that theyre going to be the best in the world at distance learning i think having a kid in a classroom is a great thing in this situation somebody thats got an underlying health condition or a weakened immunity we would never force them to do something that would be against their safety and we would want to provide options for them do you have anything to add superintendent kathy hoffman so when we put this executive order together it was really important to us to actually go back to the roadmap and think about all the different scenarios that our schools might face in this upcoming year and be prepared for significant amount of time doing distance learning and give those flexibilities and assurances so that our schools are empowered to go for learning to start which is what we want we want them to start connecting with our kids across the state so im back to my optimism that this will be a durable plan that we can use the framework and the public health data rather than setting a date which could change again this is the first that ive heard of that id have to know the details and the facts before i commented patrick patrick thanks kathy hoffman i would say at this point its unlikely that schools will be ready to start their full inperson instruction on august th but we will have the onsite learning opportunities available that soon so that will be where schools are developing plans for their at risk student populations or for serving essential workers children and so there will be continued services starting at that time but in terms of were not setting a statewide date for when school will start were recreating the framework so that our schools can make data informed decisions okay and i also want to say morgan if i can because theres been a couple of questions around the date the date was something that the superintendent and i were using to make announcements about what was happening but school in arizona has never started on a certain date weve had all kinds of flexibility and option from schools that go through the summer that take fall break and this differs really by governing board and by region in the state so the idea around the date is we wanted to pull that off the table and give the guidelines where the things that people love about arizona education the f', 'lexibility the parental choice and the additional resources while allowing the people that know how to get it done and get it done best at the local level to have those flexibilities do you want to talk about that from a public health perspective and the situation that children are in versus are vulnerable please patrick and then just really just one final thing we are changing the way kids are going to be learning at somerton and hoffman are you concerned that our state of children arent going to get the education this year that they would have gotten a year ago kathy hoffman so i want to acknowledge that our educators are going above and beyond to design completely a complete new system of online and distance learning and theyre doing everything they can to connect with kids and families whether thats calling them or online conference the video conferencing and doing everything they can to connect with their families but its never going to be the same as having all kids coming into a classroom and having all the opportunities that our schools provide and we know theres differences in family resources so some of our families dont have internet dont have computer skills dont maybe have parents that dont speak english theres just completely different types of home situations that i am very concerned about morgan i would add to the question am i concerned about our kids and the education theyre going to receive this year of course thats why were working so hard im putting a plan as the superintendent said that is durable regardless of what is in front of us so that we can maximize our childrens education make it as successful and safe as possible i am confident that our kids did not get that experience last year i think our teachers did everything they possibly could getting thrown the curve ball that came their way but our kids have some makeup to do through no fault of their own likely around math and reading and other things and the other question was am i concerned about a spike in the future and of course thats why we begin every day with the numbers we close every day with the numbers were being so vigilant around this i think the challenges that we have in arizona arent all that much different than pretty much any other state in the country and this is where it really is on leaders and local leaders and teachers and parents and superintendents to be innovative and creative and flexible in figuring this out and thats how the plan was written to not only provide the best that we could put together but to allow others to add to that plan to make it better and then to share those best practices across the state and across the country speaker were going to keep going were going to go to inaudible next were going to go to ben giles from kjzz ben go ahead dr cara christ yes so that will be part of that theyll work with their local county health departments so county health departments are always working with their schools in influenza season when there are outbreaks of disease there will be guidelines around that ben giles yes you also talked about a discouraging statistic that it seems the demand for testing has gone down even as youve worked with state officials and other private organizations to expand testing opportunities i want to open this question to dr christ as well what do you attribute to the lower demand and how maybe can you inspire confidence in arizonans to go out there and get tested well id be speculating but i think it could be a number of things one testing has been a huge challenge in arizona the testing in terms of supply chain and national resources was really going to many other places because the other places were the hot spots for so long arizona was really not in harms way writ large the way the eastern seaboard was for march and april and may and june as we began to have our increase in cases and increase in testing a lot of our wait times went longer and weve worked very hard to make it more convenient for people to get a test and then in addition sometimes the return has been too long so we think that weve addressed each of those in their turn they remain a challenge and i think oftentimes when cases are spiking and it may be more topical in the news theres more demand from people that dont feel sick or symptomatic and weve had a couple of weeks of improving numbers and its taken away some of that demand and we want to find a way that we can get more people tested people that are feeling sick or symptomatic or in a vulnerable situation or a frontline worker were going to prioritize tests for them but we want the curious now to also be tested its one way that we think well be able to further open our economy make better decisions about things that you get involved in and were also quite certain that it will lower our positivity score as well dr christ thank you josh and dr christ with respect to the present positive number the seven day average for the state is around a day average thats leading the nation that numb', 'er problematic for experts because again it shows that theres widespread community being impacted by the virus wouldnt that number alone cause you pause and have you press the brake on reopening businesses in general and possibly even shutting down the state again well we look at the number over the course of time like i said we have been prioritizing people that are sick symptomatic and working in these settings were confident yesterdays test the previous weeks test what weve seen in terms of the trend that were making responsible incremental decisions and we have shut some things down that have been the cdcs recommendation of course we dont want to do that we felt that that was necessary in which to do that and then the fact that we can expand testing logically you should see a decrease in terms of positivity and much of what were talking about is still several weeks out so oftentimes we have folks come in and say why arent you letting us know further in advance i mean this has been a dynamic and fluid situation its changed itll continue to change do you have anything more dr cara christ so we are looking at the percent positivity like i said we are looking at it from the previous weeks so as the percent positivity is reported you want it reported against the timeframe that it was actually taken not the time that its reported to the health department and so that may be one of the difference between the seven day moving average as well as like what you see on our website so we are monitoring that that is a very important factor and one of the reasons that we made the recommendation not to reopen the bars and not to reopen some of those businesses that had closed down that was also the recommendation for why we wanted to have the benchmarks so that schools could feel comfortable were not recommending that they open next week we know that we will have the data that should be on the backlog should be cleared by the st so we should have all available data well be able to use that as we develop the benchmarks and our local health departments and our local schools can make that decision dr cara christ so are you asking about what guidelines we would put in place to prevent the spread in im sorry dr cara christ okay we have recommendations on our website if you go to azhealthgov its a lot of those same type of recommendations so making sure that people can physically distance that theyre wearing masks when it is safe to do so that they are encouraging people to stay home when theyre sick and they have flexible leave policies so that people can do that dr cara christ we would recommend that they have flexible workplace or leave policy speaker we got to keep moving josh dr cara christ just like any other business were not immune to covid dr cara christ we have had cases of covid lorraine rivera hi thanks for taking my question i have two one of them for dr christ are children at any increased risk of their immune systems perhaps losing some of their ability to fight illnesses given that they havent been around each other since march and then the other question is for it may be for general mcguire but it looks like some of the communities with native american communities are still struggling if you could give us some understanding as to why they continue to be challenged given all the resources that have been directed to those areas speaker immune systems general mcguire on the tribal nations speaker thank you lorraine i know theres more questions but we really have to get going speaker one question inaudible it is well first i want to say youre right if we dont have a better turnaround time thats why weve provided resources to our private providers we need faster turnaround time if you go to the two sites that are available right now you do get a faster turnaround and thats the best and only way for contact tracing to be effective and thats of course what we want were going to be talking a lot more and have higher expectations around testing tracing and when someone is positive we want to of course see the isolation as well i want to say first thank you very much to superintendent of public instruction kathy hoffman we have high hopes and expectations for our families our kids our teachers for this upcoming school year its going to be an ongoing challenge and we have put our heads together to put a plan out there that is durable that is flexible and that has resources and we will continue to bring forth information and data along the way so that we can have the safest and most successful school year to do that the things that weve done so far so that we could slow the spread bring our case count and our positivity heading in the right direction with more to do because i come in here and im able to report improving numbers is not cause for a celebration its a cause for evidence that some of the decisions and habits and rigor and discipline that arizonans are showing is working and im asking you to please continue doing that the idea of wearing a mask '], ['no thats not on good afternoon a couple of months back in fact on june st we announced with some urgency our concerns about what was happening in imperial county california the county had experienced a significant rise in number of transmissions related to covid concern was made more paramount as it relates to the overwhelming situation for the hospital system not only in the icus but the ability to provide for emergency care more broadly diversion rates for ambulances health care personnel questions a lot of stress that was placed because of this pandemic on the county on june st we committed to a new process a new protocol to help support the county in their efforts began the process of decompressing their hospital system over patients were moved out of imperial county hospitals into surrounding and neighboring communities and in some instances we even brought patients here into northern california we approached our strategy in the county more as a strike team more as a unified command approach something you would see more traditionally as it relates to how we organize and construct our approach to dealing with other emergencies like wildfires and the like that process took shape again in the beginning of june at a time when we had transmission rates positivity rates north of in imperial county in fact it peaked at you could see on this graph the number of cases reflected in imperial county in the blue line substantially outpacing the number of cases in the rest of the state this graph certainly presents itself as a spike in cases in imperial county that required a new approach new strategies and new accountability structures and thats exactly what took place the model now as were referring to it the imperial model was all about providing supports building capacity at the local level filling in gaps meeting needs both on personal protective gear not just personnel meeting the needs of the hospital system providing additional supports new strategies and prevention from psa campaigns culturally competent messages that were delivered to individuals as well as businesses and more broadly the community at large in addition to sectoral closures that we made abundantly clear as it relates to moving forward to address the concerns that were flaring up in certain sectors of the economy in the valley you can see on this slide the number of cases as they began to spike we began to intervene you can see the medical personnel that we began to send in around june rd where we worked with not only state and county and local officials but broadened that support by getting a lot of federal supports as well from a number of federal agencies you can see after those interventions were put into place again beginning with the decompressing of the hospital system as a foundational principle more targeted supports and some additional sectoral changes as it relates to returning to a stay at home order you could see that line spiked and substantially began its decline yesterdays positivity rate still high but at a successful approach one that requires constant vigilance one that were continuing to engage in but one that long windedly is now become a model in terms of our approach the imperial approach in other parts of the state last week where we last joined each other i began the process of announcing strategies in the central valley in eight counties in the central valley for the obvious reason that you could see exampled here on this chart were starting to see not only an increase in the positivity rates i mentioned last week where i made some announcements about our interventions in central valley that we saw positivity rates on the lower end in fresno at the time at and peaking around tulare at a rate not where we were in imperial but we dont want to see it go to where imperial went and thats why we felt it was appropriate to intervene using the information using the experience the best practice the data collection the approach in imperial', ' and beginning that approach in the central valley why the central valley well again this slide underscores the concerns youre starting to see the hospitalization and icu rates increase not just positivity rates in the valley outpacing the rest of california and if you asked me today what our biggest area of concern in a state as large as ours it is indeed the central valley were seeing stabilization in other parts of the state youll see some declines in a moment when i make presentation including some stabilization and some modest declines in southern california the central valley again reinforced by this slide reinforced by our presentation in stockton last week in our announcement last week is indeed the area of our most important targeted interventions we are again doing everything we can to fill in local gaps and working with counties to assess their current dashboard as it relates to data collection identifying whatever gaps may exist or persist in their respective communities but more importantly than anything else identifying partners not just partners from governmental agencies again federal agencies five out of the eight department of defense medical teams are deployed now in the central valley again federal partnerships but also developing private partnerships critical to develop partnerships with employers critical to develop partnerships with nongovernmental organizations nonprofits ngos to again build capacity and build our collective response with a unified command approach to addressing the concerns in the valley and so thats exactly what we highlighted last week we built that partnership to include million dollars of new resources for disease investigation for contact tracing and for our isolation and quarantine efforts in addition to that we have been able to and i want to thank the sierra health foundation in particular they have been able to organize a collective effort million of additional dollars resources that philanthropy has brought to the table to supplement or increase rather the million dollar contribution that we announced last week and this is for rent supplies really helping individuals with utility bills and the like and focusing individuals utility bills and the like and focusing on the most vulnerable and the most vulnerable families and remember this is and dr galley has made this abundantly clear in a number of his presentations weve made it abundantly clear over the course of the last number of months as well disproportionately this disease is impacting our diverse communities disproportionately impacting the latino community disproportionately impacting the community in the central valley and so when we talk about the central valley i hope we can really paint a picture in terms of our consciousness of how impactful this has been on the latinx community and thats why our targeted interventions disproportionately are focusing on essential workforce on farm workers on critical workforce and hospitality retail sector and the like that is being impacted by this disease and so i wanted to begin today as we left off last week reinforcing the merits of the approach we took in imperial county recognizing again good enough never is recognizing as i do as we do that the effort is ongoing theres a constancy to our focus theres not just a passing interest in these efforts theyre not episodic theres a full blown commitment to follow through to bend this curve to suppress the growth and ultimately extinguish this virus which is indeed our long term goal or at least mitigate its impacts through therapeutics and vaccination as it relates to the efforts statewide to do the same i want to give you some good news and that is our number of positive cases yesterday was that is a one day number and again ive made this point abundant over the past and that is i dont look to one day numbers they go up they go down theres some weekend reporting often that is example on mondays thats why the seven day average', ' becomes even more important and that seven day average youll see its that seven day average by the way is down roughly from the previous seven day average thats good news decline the last time you saw a slide like this the numbers was north of daily average cases to be exact so from cases seven day average from a week ago now down decline from our previous reporting period again thats case numbers and i caution folks look ive said this in the past others have said this some for different purposes than the purpose which we reinforce this as we increase our tests youre going to see an increase in case numbers i caution people not to focus as much on that but to look at positivity rates and look at hospital rates and icu rates in the state of california theyve become more profoundly significant from the perspective of mortality from the perspective of our healthcare delivery system and our capacity we want to test as many people as we can but the purpose of the test is not just to show a number its an effort to have a sense of where the community is spread is how we can mitigate that spread how we can help support our contact tracers isolate quarantine people and ultimately mitigate the impact to our hospital system and into our icus and so thats why the positivity rate this number youve watched these presentations youre very familiar with this slide this positivity rate is so important here is extending on the narrative of some early good signs decline in the seven day average total number of positive cases but the positivity rate is also seeing a decline as weve increased our daily average tests and you can see the number almost daily average test about just shy of tests yesterday a little bit more than that the day prior we actually reached tests a few days ago but our average daily tests continue to go up the good news is the total number of people testing positive is now going down we have gone down to this reflected in this slide over a day period shows that number that we presented to you on multiple occasions now again tracking down to this is the day number i often provide you the seven day positivity rate the last time i was with you we made a presentation formally with you where i shared slides which was on the th of july not the presentation in stockton last week the seven day positivity rate was got to about at its peak the seven day positivity rate is lower now than the days its down to so day positivity rate reflected in the slide the seven day positivity rate now down to its not where it needs to be and is still too high but again it is good to see this number trending down not trending up not surprisingly as we see positivity rate begin to trend down increased number of people being tested percentage of people being tested relative to the numbers being tested lower we are now not surprisingly seeing hospitalizations go down modestly decrease in the total number of positive cases in our hospitals over a day period decrease the last time i shared slides with you we had seen a increase remember it was much as a few weeks back over a day period so growth now were seeing decline last slide set we shared with you over a week ago showed a increase so again a decline in total hospitalizations not surprisingly youll see the healthcare system capacity with total number of patients declining its just shy of of our total capacity its holding relatively steady not increasing as youve seen in some previous slides hospitalizations go down we encourage to see icu admissions also trending down last slide deck we provided increase in icu admissions youll see reflected in this slide decrease in icu admissions so again these are statewide numbers it does not reflect the reality in the central valley doesnt necessarily reflect the reality where you are living in a particular county a particular part of the state but the overall trend both again positivity rates hospitalizations now icu is showing a decrease from where we were ', 'over a week ago encouraging signs but one week does not make a kind of trend that gives us confidence to generate headlines we are looking forward to that and well need to see another few weeks of this kind of data to come in to feel more confident about where we are as a state the good news is we do feel confident in our critical care capacity the icu numbers declining the total number of icu patients reflected here in this graph to our capacity dropped modestly from to hospitalizations about but did not decline still within a percentage point here we were able to see modest decline over the last reporting period when we presented the slide deck counties are now on our monitoring list youll recall counties when we announced that santa clara county was added to our list when we were in stockton last week now counties this includes san mateo county on low list counties in the state of california though again these counties represent the vast majority of the population in the state and this county monitoring this is profoundly important to all of you that live in those counties as it relates to the sectorial guidelines we put out more restrictive in these counties than in other counties and certainly more restrictive as it relates to reopening our schools goal ultimately is to get off this list for two weeks and that gives us some confidence based on cdc guidelines our own experience here in the state of california to consider making modifications and certainly along the guidelines that we put out as it relates to our public education system and private school system as well that day period is foundational in terms of any subsequent modifications to distance learning which is foundationally required in these counties ill conclude as always to encourage people if you are living with an individual whos tested positive for covid its incredibly important because of mixed families multigenerational families were seeing a lot of spread now in peoples backyards their front yards as well is in their living rooms and thats why we thought important to reinforce remind people of the importance if you are living with someone whos tested positive or has come into contact with someone whos tested positive please stay at home dont share items do the kind of disinfecting that is foundational in terms of mitigating the spread of this disease well continue to highlight this area of focus as it continues to be one of the more challenging in vaccine areas in terms of mitigating the spread of the coronavirus accordingly we remind you as always the most important nonpharmaceutical intervention you can make is wearing these masks again doing everything in your power to physically distance yourself from people that are not part of that cohort and your household continue to wash your hands more broadly and minimize mixing i just want to reinforce this it needs to be reinforced even more minimize mixing to the extent possible again that mixing could occur in your brain backyard your front yard but also again in your living room when you bring people outside your immediate household overextended family members or just generationally you are connecting with loved ones and mixing in a way that can increase the likelihood of the spread of the virus and so thats the update for the day i want to just make one final point reference and its an important and that is total number of deaths in this state has increased over the course of the last few weeks this again for us is a point of obvious concern and for the family members each and every life lost is devastating and our heart goes out including a young person in fresno that lost their lives a teenager and this is a sober reminder of how deadly this disease is and how it can impact anybody and while its absolutely true and i dont want to be an alarmist its absolutely true that number of people that contact this disease that are in their late teens even early teens the likelihood of deaths is very very lo', 'w the reality is we tragically lost a teenager to this virus and its just sober reminder of how powerful and impactful and deadly this disease remains to be and how important it is to do the kind of work we all must do as a society as a community and as individuals to do what we can to mitigate that spread to wear those masks to physically distance to avoid the kind of mixing large crowds and outside your immediate household as much as you possibly can additional lives were lost in our last reporting period yesterday but i want to just caution you is a lower number than youve seen in the past the average numbers now well north of and with the increase weve experienced over the last few weeks the lagging number lagging indicator always in term of the deaths this number is reflected as a lagging indicator meaning were likely to see those numbers remain stubbornly high over the course of the next number of days potentially next week or so were going to monitor that closely well talk openly and honestly as much as we can about it i dont want you to be misled into feeling some more confidence about that numbers again look at those seven and day averages not just one day over another day lives on average weve lost a day as an example just over the day period as it relates to the deaths associated with covid so thats an update on where we are i again want to remind everybody of the importance of targeting our focus and continuing to build capacity and build partnerships we continue to do that county by county health director by health director and business by business and i will be remiss ill just close on this i want to thank the business community weve been out alcohol beverage control community weve been out alcohol beverage control and been out in bars and restaurants and thousands of inperson visits osha has been out in tens of thousands of visits i just want to mark this as a point of consideration and thought the vast majority of businesses are doing everything in their power doing their best under these very difficult circumstances and the vast majority that are not in compliance come into compliance very very quickly i want to just acknowledge that and recognize that perfect rarely is on the menu people are doing their best under extraordinary circumstances both as individuals as customers as employers their employees its exampled in all the outreach thats been done and the incredible compliance that weve seen we havent seen it everywhere and we are putting out citations obviously this is being advanced at the local level as well substantially from an enforcement frame including enforcing on mask mandates as well local government taking the lead in that space and amplifying some of the efforts that are happening at the state level but i do want to acknowledge how the business sector is doing and under incredible circumstances how grateful we are to all of you that are represented in that respect and to all of the employees and customers that are doing their best as well under very trying and difficult circumstances with that of course were happy to answer any questions katie orr hi thank you for taking my question as schools get ready to reopen distance learning at the vast majority of them there are some districts that are requiring teachers to actually go into their classroom and teach their distance learning from those schools that has some teachers upset they cite safety concerns also childcare issues what is your take on that do you think teachers should be required to go to schools to teach no i think that has to be done first of all we give a lot of discretion to local what we call leas these are local education agencies authorities local capacity to make those decisions but based upon bargaining based upon working with labor and making those decisions in a collaborative frame i dont believe anyone should be forced to put their life and health at risk period full stop if people feel their lives are being put at ', 'risk and their health is being put at risk it is incumbent upon us to call that out we have been working very closely with organized labor we are very grateful for their support and guidance of a lot of the information that we put out and the formal guidelines that weve put out and the announcement we made a few weeks ago as it relates to the upcoming school year its been done in the spirit of collaboration and cooperation and i expect and really demand respectfully that that spirit of collaboration and cooperation manifests at the local level and people not be put into harms way as caregivers as teachers as support staff from janitors to bus drivers as secretaries to maintenance workers as well obviously as our children yomara lopez hello some legislators are presenting different bills at the capitol right now that have to do with protecting the tenants who havent been able to pay rent because of the pandemic assembly member chiu with coauthor senator inaudible presented a bill that will provide rental and mortgage relief are you going to support this bill or what bills are you going to support to help those who for a fifth month in a row wont be able to pay rent thank you yeah thank you thank you for the important question as you know the judicial council has an order that currently expires on august th you may be very familiar others are certainly familiar with the executive orders that ive put out going back many many months and the support we provide the clarification the guidance we put out to encourage local government to make decisions as it relates to evictions and the like themselves this is specific to your question we are actively engaged with legislative leadership actively engaged on a number of these specific bills and we are working have been for a number of weeks my team and representative staffs in the legislature to see where we can find common ground to move forward with the kind of acuity and focus and determination thats required at the moment we deeply recognize peoples anxiety we deeply recognize whats at stake as a consequence the spirit of collaboration i assure you is alive and well with not only the authors that you referenced but their respective leadership that demonstrably is committed and focused to this so we are engaged the legislatures back in session and we are working in real time were working against that clock that august th clock as it relates to the judicial councils decision to put this back in the hands of the legislature and the executive branch well be up to that task adam beam you had said that there would be a process for elementary schools to apply for a waiver so that they can have classroom instruction even if they are in a county on the states monitoring list but theres still no process and some schools that are interested in applying say that time is running out so when will the details of this waiver process be revealed this afternoon and weve been working very closely with many of those same officials that had expressed concern we have been engaged in a very collaborative process over the last week in particular there were some modifications that were made last week based upon the input from many in the educational field not just our health field as well so this afternoon jim rupe thank you very much good afternoon a question for dr ghaly too but first of all for you we hear that contact tracing is very very important in helping to slow or stop the spread but yet we dont hear much about contact tracing here in the states so could you update us on what is happening with that process of contact tracing no i appreciate the questions dr ghaly will be up here in just a moment let me just say a number of things and weve made number of presentations over the course of the last number of months as it relates to our partnership with ucsf our partnership with ucla to train a cohort of contact tracers we announced a few weeks back that we have trained over meeting our phase goal', 's of contact tracers we made additional modifications to our approach and the protocols relating to contact tracing based upon the increase in the total number of positive cases statewide that required a modification of some of our original strategies related to contact tracing including by the way making available contact tracers this is fundamental in terms of keeping our children and teachers safe in the upcoming school years when we do reopen for inperson learning which is foundational and is ultimately our goal and our commitment if we can mitigate the spread and see a decline in the spread of this disease but to make available to the school districts in partnership with local health officials these same contact tracers we have a new database system weve been very fortunate to have the optingin of the vast majority of counties into the statewide database system its a system that is also being utilized and deployed in some other states including massachusetts and that provides the ability in real time to share information in this space with that let me ask dr ghaly to provide you a little bit more information about the contact tracing talk a little bit about vitamin d and talk about when indeed someone who may have been exposed what is that gestation period for determining if indeed they have tested positive or indeed are a carrier even asymptomatic carrier of covid dr ghaly dr ghaly so we continue to build up that workforce in anticipation that as we continue to do the things we know reduce our case counts we build up that workforce so that we match them and we can begin to identify all new cases and support those so that they dont become big outbreaks as we try to reduce transmission dr ghaly so the first thing to say is if you are at all symptomatic with covidlike symptoms we encourage you to get tested immediately reach out to a provider if you have one go to the covidcagov website go to our testing page and sign up for a test there we think that should happen immediately if you are a close contact that means somebody who spent or more minutes six or so feet closer to somebody whos known covidpositive lets say in an indoor gathering where youre not unfortunately using a mask we know that the masks protect quite a bit in reducing transmission if youre experiencing symptoms you should go immediately and get tested if youre not and youre a close contact waiting about two days roughly after that contact i think is probably the best time to go get tested dr ghaly as it relates to vitamin d and other things to enhance your immune system as a physician we always want people to practice good healthy behaviors make sure that you get your rest that you eat well that if your doctor or somebody has recommended vitamins that you take those in order that we make sure that everyone is as wellpositioned and suited to fight off not just covid but anything else that might be mixing around the community thank you dr ghaly next question david baker yes i wanted to ask now that we are seeing some progress in the positivity rates and the hospitalizations what do you think is making the difference here is it enforcement actions at the local and the state level as you were talking about is it people taking mask mandates more seriously or the advice not to gather more seriously what is helping us out here yeah i think you answered your own question and i say that with deep respect because i think its a good question an important question i think it is all of the above and growing recognition in a state where we flattened the curve we never experienced the spikes other parts of the country experienced in our own capacity to manifest meaning our own individual capacity to make better decisions to physically distance to wash our hands to avoid mixing as well as the modifications lets be candid these sectoral modifications that have been very very difficult and very trying for small businesses in particular that have just beared a huge brunt', ' of the that have just beared a huge brunt of the impact all of these things in total have made the impact at least as it relates to what were experiencing recently that said these are just a few days five out of six days weve seen a decline in icus weve seen some stabilization in most parts of the state though not in every part of the state central valley being the obvious area of concern and hospitalizations is encouraging at the same time we can quickly find ourselves back to where we were just a few weeks ago a month ago with significant increases if we do not maintain our vigilance if we do not maintain our focus and our commitment again this virus is not going away its not just going to take labor day weekend off its not going to take halloween off or the holidays off until we have quality of therapeutics until we have a vaccine we are going to be living with this virus and i think if theres any lesson that weve learned from the california experience while it is true the positivity rates in this state have never manifested as they have in other parts of this country the reality is our first effort we made tremendous progress because million strong really met that moment and did everything in their power to mitigate the growth and spread of this virus as we began to modify our stay at home orders people began to mix as people began to put down well some cases put down their mask literally not just figuratively we started to see that case rate grow we started to see the background rates begin to grow the community spread begin to grow and so we had to tighten that back up so let us not make that well lets not relive that experience again as we work again our way through the first wave of this pandemic we anticipate the second wave in the fall and that second wave also challenged by what dr ghaly just said as it relates to flu season on top of covid likely having a resurgence in that second wave around the same time and the impact that can have and the stress that can have on our system and so all of this is just a reminder of the vigilance that is required at the moment speaker thank you several states from hawaii to new york states with lower case rates have implemented orders to require visitors to quarantine for two weeks why has california not done that can the state really get a handle on this and keep it if youre not quarantining people that are coming in from hotspots well i think the numbers we presented today prove that we can get a handle on it the numbers that we experienced the ability over the course of the pandemic going back many many months we never did a statewide moratorium on people coming into the state and yet we were able to mitigate the growth of the spread early on and youre now seeing this modest decline that weve exampled here today so to the extent and again ive been very honest about this open about it in previous questions and i appreciate yours we will consider that if we feel its necessary critical and important but at the moment based upon the progress we have made we feel we cant get our arms around this in a judicious way again the key is when you do come in to the state that you abide by all the rules and regulations that our health officers have put forth the rules and regulations that many of you are very familiar with and that is incumbent upon all of us to exercise that kind of vigilance and promote an educational environment and thats what youre seeing with our psa campaign increased efforts around raising awareness so everybody is made more familiar with the rules and regulations and practices accordingly roz plater yes thank you what do you tell the businesses that have said to us they feel like theyre in a bad ping pong match santa clara county for example they opened up and two days later they shut down san mateo county they opened up two weeks later they had to shut back down they hire people they got to lay people off theyre not certain some of them that they can survive ', 'what do you say to those people and is there any kind of help available to them yeah well weve provided an account we have in the state of california we put up tens of millions of dollars for small businesses that otherwise would fall through the cracks on the ppp program as well as sba programs that many small businesses avail themselves to many others are simply unable to access those resources and the state through our ibank has created a micro loan program that we want to not only socialize and make more visible but make available for those that are working through this incredibly challenging time and youre absolutely right look i know a thing or two about small business its been a point of pride point of privilege in my life to have started many many small businesses i deeply and i can assure you deeply appreciate the stress that many of these small business men and women are going through families that are literally on the line and the impact its having in terms of their dreams and their future and their health and i can only express deep empathy as well as gratitude and a resolve for all of us to do what we can to mitigate the spread of this disease the sooner we do that we can get our kids back to school the sooner we do that we can get back to some semblance of modified normalcy as it relates to being able to open up our businesses with some expectation that they can remain open so they dont have to go through this whipsaw back and forth back and forth and so deep respect deep empathy and let me just in terms of being a little bit more prescriptive offer this covidcagov covidcagov is our resource site and if you are one of those business representatives that has just been exampled please go to that site avail yourself to the resources on that site learn about what we are making available in our state through our ibank what gobiz which is our business wing of our state gobiz what they avail in terms of supports to help mitigate your stress and anxiety there are all kinds theres a suite of resources beyond just the direct business loans that the state has theres also a lot of local resources on top of that clearly in addition to the federal resources were trying to supplement that through philanthropy and so we want to make sure that you at least take a look at that site try to get in touch with some of our key personnel and we can see what we can do to address your unique because every business is unique unique circumstance jeremy white hi as im sure youve seen various interest groups labor healthcare and environmental groups are pushing for a tax on the highest earners the california teachers association among them saying they need more revenue to be able to get back to school safely i am curious to know if you would be willing to entertain an increase in taxes on californias top earners including potentially in a special session yeah right now as ive said around special sessions if its necessary to have a special session you referenced a special session in terms of revenue theres been other requests of consideration for special session related to health and other needs well consider a special session for a suite of considerations if that becomes necessary as it relates to the broader issue there are many different proposals many that may be coming to my desk many that are being negotiated in the legislature many that may end up on the ballot as jeremy you become familiar with me and perhaps every recent i dont want to necessarily opine on the process in the legislature with hundreds of bills still pending consideration reconsideration and are currently being debated discussed and negotiated not only among the two houses but also with the administration i dont want to get into those details but as it relates to revenue well have ample opportunity this november to consider a number of things that likely will end up on the november ballot in addition to a number of legislative proposals not least of which the one ', 'that you just referenced elex michaelson thank you im wondering in terms of congratulations on the progress that you announced i know you said weve got a long ways to go but is there a specific measurable that youre looking at to achieve in order to maybe get rid of some of the restrictions weve seen and more broadly bigger picture question californias been dealing with this in a vacuum im wondering what are the key lessons youve learned from governors of other states that have done this well and other states that maybe havent done it as well were constantly engaged and were really blessed to have a very robust national governors association and bipartisanship that has been manifest hogan the current chair soon to be the exchair a new chair will be coming in this month a republican from maryland whos just been an outstanding partner to governors all across the state making that organization available sharing best practices in real time providing resources to really drill down on the merit of your question looking at procurement strategies looking at testing protocols looking at contact tracing and the like and so across the spectrum weve been able to resource one another pick the brains of our respective colleagues as well as connect as we have more formally as you recall with our western states approach where they have the ability now in real time we have the ability in real time through that partnership to engage our chiefs of staff have consistent i think its a weekly now calls where theyre comparing and contrasting best practices discussing things that theyre considering their respective governors and administrations are considering in terms of announcements or approaches and really getting feedback in real time its turned out to be an extraordinarily robust partnership and turned out partnership is working in ways that perhaps people did not anticipate in the beginning and so its just an example to give you a sense of the kind of work that were doing in the spirit of collaboration and sharing of best practices and practices frankly that all of us want to push to the dustbin that said the broader issue around what were looking for is a consistent decline or consistent stabilization now i caution we had consistent stabilization in our icus in hospitalizations and positivity rates in the state early on in this pandemic and so its not just stabilizations were looking for is we want to see some marked decline stabilization and a commensurate effort which is critical of education about any modification subsequent modifications to our guidance and stay at home orders and sectoral strategies what i think is the most important thing that ive reflected on the last number of months ive made this comment in the past is that when we began to modify our state home orders we were focused as understandably we needed to be with industry and employers and we needed to be equally focused in educating the public about what these modifications were and were not and so a big and focused education campaign around mitigating the spread of this virus and transmission of this virus after weve seen a decline stabilization is foundational in terms of any subsequent efforts to reopen and so thats were looking forward to and based on this last week we believe we will once again experience that stabilization as long as people continue to practice the physical distancing that theyre so familiar with wear a mask do what you can on sanitation avoid or at least minimize as much mixing as you possibly can i appreciate everybodys good work i thank them for the well everything we presented here today is because of you and your commitment your resolve and your hard work and so i just want to extend appreciation for your patience your perseverance and your faith and devotion to this cause of mitigating this disease ending this pandemic here in the state look forward to catching back up sharing some updated information in the next day or two thank you ever'], ['thanks a lot for being here i cant tell whether youre smiling or not but thanks for being here i want to take a few minutes to tell you a little bit about what i think we should be doing right now and then be happy to take questions for weeks weve been seeing the warning signs numbers dont lie infection rates are now going up in more states than there are going down more than people in the united states have lost their lives and those numbers and new infections continue to grow at alarming rate and once again is confronting the simple fact that we wont be able to solve the economic crisis without a rigorous public health approach theyre not separable despite the administrations propaganda that their response should be a cause for celebration despite president trumps requests that we should slow down testing because he thinks it makes him look bad the covid is still here and the daily threat to american health and prosperity is continuing it didnt have to be this way month after month as other leaders in other countries took the necessary steps to get the virus under control failed us month after month as many of us urged him to step up and do his job he failed us just look at the record in january i along with others sounded the alarm of the coronavirus outbreak told the country that covid is quote totally under control and then everything will quote work out well in february i warned about the failure to get information that we needed from the chinese government what i said was the president should demand xi produce the evidence demand it said quote were in great shape reported chinas president said it was quote doing very well in march i set forth a detailed plan for federally funded testing sites across the country as well as guaranteed emergency paid leave later that month i called for a full and immediate use of the defense production act critical critical for delivering supplies that were basically needed accused healthcare workers how did he respond he accused health workers of stealing your masks thats what he said healthcare workers are stealing the masks thats why we dont have them in april i released a plan to secure the supply chain for personal protective equipment surge nationwide testing through a pandemic testing board and launch a nationwide health corp to focus on contact tracing trumps suggestions americans should inject disinfectants into their bodies in may i condemned the false choice between preserving public health and our economy i urged the administration to focus on the basic public health measures like testing that would enable us to sustain our economic recovery trumps response he pushed for reopening without regard to safety and called testing quote frankly overrated this month i outlined a path to reopen our country safely and sustainably it provided workers small businesses schools state local governments the tools resources and guidance that they would need trumps proposal he set a cutoff date for federal funding of testing sites in several states and actually went to court to take away healthcare for million people by trying to get rid of obamacare and now is in retreat remember back in march when i called and he called we talked about the need to act like we were at war with the virus he called himself a war time president remember when he exhorted the nation to sa', 'crifice together and quote in the face of this inevitable and invisible enemy what happened now its almost july and it seems like our war time president has surrendered waived the white flag and left the battlefield today were facing a serious threat and we have to meet it we have to meet it as one country but the president gives no direction and he pits us against one another we cant continue like this half recovery and half getting worse we cant continue half wearing masks and half rejecting science we cant continue half with a plan and half just hoping for the best we wont defeat this virus with a piecemeal approach lifting restrictions prematurely increasing the volatility of the crisis raising the likelihood of needing to reimpose restrictions until our science catches up to reality until we have better treatment for those who become infected and ultimately are safe proven widely available vaccines we have to continue to do all we can as the people in the government to keep our fellow americans safe and healthy today im releasing a plan with the steps i believe should undertake immediately to build on the roadmap i released back in march that would have saved lives if it had been adopted its a plan to save lives in the months ahead once again i encourage him to adopt this plan and in its entirety this is too important for politics first testing testing testing more testing is not only how you find more cases of coronavirus mr president its how you stop the coronavirus cases testing followed by rigorous contact tracing quarantine and isolation protocols for those who have been exposed people arent waiting in lines for miles and miles long in baking hot cars for drive through nasal swabs for the fun of it theyre doing it so they can protect themselves but even more importantly they know when they have this mask on theyre protecting others theyre protecting others we know were not where we need to be in testing there are still hospitals and nursing homes that dont have access to the tests they need testing is how we see whats happening in communities all across the country its our eyes on the ground without that testing were flying blind thats why its so important to have reliable access to testing everywhere we need to increase federal support for testing that includes doubling the number of drive through testing sites and keep increasing them until there are no more lines we should create a pandemic testing board to spearhead a nationwide campaign so every worker every worker whos called back to their job can have the confidence that they and their fellow workers are not infected experts agree that we need more contact tracers to track the path of this virus individual states like new york and california are already hiring and training thousands of tracers but we need to do more including hiring at least federally funded workers to perform contact tracing and other public health tasks and they should begin to be trained now second every single frontline worker should have the personal protective equipment that they need to be safe five months into this crisis and our healthcare workers still are forced to scramble for their own supplies and have to reuse these masks shift after shift hundreds hundreds of healthcare workers have died from covid and tens of thousands have become infected it should', ' be zero on both counts for these healthcare workers if they had the right equipment you know how are we this many months into this and still still dont have what we need thats why we have a defense production act you know mr president use your authority mr president use it this week scale up the production of n masks the steps youve taken so far havent gotten the job done mr president fix the shortage of ppe for our healthcare workers before you tee off another round of golf we cant just look at where we are today were going to need these masks and gloves and face shields for the foreseeable future and we need to be ready we know more is coming thirdly we should be laser focused on treatments and vaccines we should be leading a coordinated global approach on the science not disregarding experts while pushing dangerous and disproved drugs as if theyre treatments theres been some progress toward treatment and vaccines but the administration hasnt been transparent about how they plan to manufacture enough doses to make sure theres equitable distribution to scale i hope theyre doing it now i called for a while ago they should be providing million to have a plan now exactly how theyre going to distribute this so every american has access when and if the vaccines available they may be doing it but we have no transparency let us see mr president the white house should report weekly on this progress we cant end up in the same scratching and distribution problems that we had in testing we need to make sure the customers arent being gouged by new drug and therapies in prices when theyre developed we have to immediately restore our relationship with the world health organization for all its shortcomings and missteps around covid this is why who was created it is essential to coordinating the global response during a pandemic and the united states should be leading that response as we had in the past covid will likely worsen at the outset of flu season this year so we need put in place measures now now to ensure the seasonal flu vaccine can be ready available and administered safely to those who need it under social distancing guidelines especially for seniors fourthly we need real plans real guidelines with uniform nationwide standards to help us chart our economic reopening whatever weve been doing now is not working the state by state approach will only produce confusion and slow any progress you all reported to cdc tried to clear guidelines about what stages of reopening should look like the administration delayed and scaled back those plans we need clear evidence clear evidencebased steps that states can adopt now both the standard must be met in order to safely proceed with further openings and the reposition of social distancing rules when cases begin to rise this is not rocket science we need to support schools and childcare programs so parents if and when they can return to work are confident that their children will be safe and cared for we should be holding them for we should be holding and providing a sticker saying safe for shoppers a certification to stores that prove theyre minimizing their customers risk and exposure we absolutely needed a clear messages from the very top of our federal government that everyone needs to wear a mask in public period period wear a mask its not just about you its ', 'about your family its about your neighbors its about your colleagues its about keeping other people safe it helps you yes but its about keeping other people safe its a simple measure it is also one of the most effective ways we can do the right thing it may be inconvenient it may be uncomfortable but its the right thing to do as an american protect your coworkers and neighbors and finally we need to protect the populations most at risk our seniors our black and brown populations native communities that are being hit the hardest vulnerable populations with preexisting conditions know that this continued growth in case numbers is causing a lot of fear and anxiety people especially older americans and those with loved ones in nursing homes i get calls all the time theyre simply scared theyre frightened this isnt just taking a toll on the physical health its an emotional cost as well we cant expect vulnerable populations to quarantine indefinitely without support i want them to know that their health and safety will be my responsibility if im your president and i will not abandon you these are five fairly straightforward steps that are going to help defeat this pandemic and if you suspect that a lot of these steps are the same sorts of things i was talking about in march when i released my first covid response youd be right if it feels like youre hearing the experts talk about the same issues for months youd be right these have always been the steps that government needed to put in place to meet the threat statewide lockdowns that so many americans lived under for months were intended to buy us time to get our act together instead of using that time to prepare ourselves squandered it now here we are more than three months later were hardly better prepared than we were in march infections are on the rise the threat of massive spikes that overwhelm the capacity of our healthcare system is on the horizon americans anxious and out of work are fearful for their lives and their livelihoods is doing next to nothing about it mr president the crisis is real the crisis is real and its surging mr president your promises and predictions and wishful thinking pulled out of thin air are not only doing the country no good youre making them lose even more faith in their government america knows this crisis isnt behind us even if you dont they see whats happening even if you refuse to mr president they know we need a coordinated national plan we need it now even though you dont mr president and wont do it you called yourself a cheerleader we dont need a cheerleader mr president we need a president mr president a president who will level with the american people a president who will tell us the unvarnished truth a president who will take responsibility instead of always blaming others a president who will listen to the experts follow the science allow them to speak a president who will lead and be an example for the nation wear a mask keep your distance limit the size of crowds mr president this is not about you its about the health and wellbeing of the american public american people dont make enormous sacrifices over the past four months so they could just waste their time and you could waste all the efforts they have undertaken with your midnight rantings and tweets they dont make these sacrifices so you could ignore t', 'he science and turn responsible steps like wearing masks into a political statement and they certainly didnt do it mr president so you could wash your hands and walk away from this responsibility maybe there are times this nation needs a cheerleader now is not one of them america needs a president whatever does or does not do we cant know today what the state of the covid pandemic will be next january but im almost certain i hope i turn out to be wrong im almost certain it wont be over if i should have the honor of being elected president on the day im sworn in ill get right to work implementing all aspects of the response that remain undone ill have more to say about my day one covid agenda in the weeks to come but my response will begin well before i take the oath of office it will start as soon as the election is decided ill be a president who respects scientists who wont censor their ability to speak directly to the american people i will immediately reach out to dr anthony fauci to ask him to continue his incredible service to the country and ill have from day one ready to go the best medical experts and scientists to advise on our response maybe most importantly i will listen to them and let them speak freely and ill work with the governors and mayors of both parties from every state territory and tribe its a simple proposition folks were all in this together we got to fight this together well emerge from this stronger because we did it together and im confident we can may god bless you all and may god protect our troops and im happy to take questions if you have them they gave me a list of how to recognize is alex ap out there couldnt tell when the mask alex well look first of all congress and the intelligence committees on the congress both parties should demand the facts this seems to be a moving story as i was leaving i had the television on as i put on my shirt and i understand theres even some more information thats come out today about what was known one of two things this president talks about cognitive capability he doesnt seem to be cognitively aware of whats going on he either reads andor gets briefed on important issues and he forgets it or he doesnt think its necessary that he need to know it but the fact is that at a minimum at a minimum the discrepancy allegedly within the intelligence community as reported some thought it was more certain and others thought it was less certain that should be resolved the president should have on day one said i want you to come before me in the situation room and lay out the differences and discretions who is saying what lets get to the bottom of it number one number two its clear to me that and i dont know whether he did he should have immediately contacted our joint chiefs of staff gotten them all in one room and sat and said okay what are we doing to prevent this what are we doing to prepare to deal with this if this is happening how are we doing this what are we doing thirdly he should at a minimum have picked up the phone and said vladimir old buddy if any of this is true and it doesnt cease immediately youve got a big problem a big problem and make it clear get to the bottom of this it appears as though from what i have and i dont have access to classified information anymore but if what i have heard over the last week and the recent repor', 'ting that it was in the pdb the presidential daily brief the presidential daily brief is something i read every single day as vice president the president read it every day i was briefed every morning before i got to the white house and then again so the idea that somehow he didnt know or isnt being briefed it is a dereliction of duty if thats the case and if he was briefed and nothing was done about this thats a dereliction of duty i guess the best way for me to end this is i was talking to jill my wife jill and i dont see her get outraged very often but she started asking she said what would you have done if beau was still in harms way and this information came out and the president beau is my son who was im sorry i apologize who served in iraq for a year was in the army but if hed been in afghanistan what would you do what are those parents thinking out there what are those sons and daughters husbands and wives its an absolute dereliction of duty if any of this is even remotely true so i think the president has a lot to answer for and we should get the answers quickly quickly if these allegations are true and he did nothing about any of this then in fact i think the public should unrelated to my running conclude that this man isnt fit to be president of the united states of america i was told nbc mike mikes great relief he doesnt have to follow me every day around the country well this is the most unusual campaign i think in modern history but i start off with the premise mike that im going to follow the docs orders off of the premise mike that im going to follow the docs orders not just for me but for the country and that means that i am not going to be holding rallies i am not going to be for example you all are here but i think the school has put those circles around so we keep the social distancing everybody has masks on as soon as i finish this ill put my mask back on and so its all been almost all been virtual although i have gone to houston i have gone into pennsylvania i have gone to virginia i have traveled but when i do i get in make my case and leave take questions and leave but you know me id much rather be out there with people because thats where i get the greatest feel i can get a sense of what by the look in their eyes by the plaintive voices that they have and what theyre concerned about but notwithstanding that i have been surprised the irony is we probably reach more people directly on oneonone you all particularly those of you who are with television stations you all know that when youre on youre having a onetoone conversation with someone out there because theres one person at the tv looking at you i never quite thought of it that way before but they tell me million people have watched what i have done from home in the half a dozen things weve gone out and done and so the irony is i think were probably communicating directly in detail with more people than we would have otherwise but id much rather be doing it in person so far it remains to be seen i dont want to jinx myself i know the polling data is very good but i think its really early its much too early to make any judgment i think weve got a whole lot more work to do ive planned on laying out in detail my economic plan as to how we recover from this plan on dealing with foreign working out in detail what im going to do ', 'if i am elected president so the people know whats coming i dont know that that answers your question mike but they have not offered a classified briefing and as this proceeds i may very well do that ive been talking to i have a significant foreign policy staff as you know that matter of fact dozens of them so i had a long meeting with my former national security advisors former secretaries of state et cetera and got in their read what theyve heard so far but if it doesnt get cleared up quickly then i will seek and ask if i can be briefed i can hardly wait inaudible well i think there are sort of three categories on that one any institution that chose a name and wants to now jettison that name thats a decision for them to make for whatever reason they make it so im assuming the board of trustees at princeton university made the judgment about the woodrow wilson school i dont know but it was made within the context of an institution that chose that name and now no longer wants to be associated with that name and i think the president is well secondly i think theres a distinction between as the former mayor of new orleans said the difference between reminders and remembrances of history and recovering from history and so the idea of comparing whether or not george washington owned slaves or thomas jefferson owned slaves and somebody who was in rebellion committing treason running trying to take down the union to keep slavery i think theres a distinction there and so i think the idea of bringing down i think all those confederate monuments to confederate soldiers and generals et cetera who strongly supported secession and the maintenance of slavery and going to war to do it i think those statues belong in museums they dont belong in public places and i think with regard to those statues that are in monuments like the jefferson memorial or whatever i think theres an obligation that the government protect those monuments because theyre different than thats a remembrance it is not a dealing with revering somebody who had that view they had much broader views they may have things in their past that are now and then distasteful but thats a judgment for the for example taking down toppling christopher columbus statue george washingtons statue or et cetera i think that is something that is the government has an opportunity and a responsibility to protect from happening no i have not been protected i have not been tested for the coronavirus for two reasons one i have had no symptoms as my mother would say knock on wood and number two i havent wanted to take anybody elses place in the process but the secret service they all get tested theyre around my home and anyone who comes into my home including staff is tested just to determine whether they have the virus i expect what im going to do so it doesnt look like im moving in the front of the line here is be tested relatively soon my daughter has been tested she was in florida shes a social worker working with the boys and girls club she came home and before she could come home shes been tested twice so to make sure shes clear and quarantined she lives in philadelphia but i havent yet i have not been tested yet yes im sorry who was i supposed to go to next anybody i got to make sure i get the wilmington newspaper here before i leave or ill be dead we will the mor', 'e i have an opportunity i will do it i can but i will not but i will tell him heres the deal the idea that putin or any other foreign leader can engage in attempting to manipulate the presidential election the idea that he continues his activities in central and eastern europe that hes doing the idea that it can be done without any consequences is not going to happen if im president in my administration that ranges from everything to making sure we go to the united nations security council all the way to imposing sanctions that would be commensurate with the action that he has taken that is inappropriate but i have had some very blunt straightforward conversations with president putin when i was vice president and before that and i think one of the reasons why it appears as though he doesnt want me to be president he knows well have more blunt conversations one thing i hesitate to do is follow anything the president does at all because he usually does it all wrong we are putting together a list of a group of african american women who are qualified and have the experience to be in the court i am not going to release that until we go further down the line of vetting them as well and just like logical questions about vice president im not releasing the names of all the vice presidential potential nominees there are a number of women of color there are latina women there are asian there are across the board and were just underway now in the hard vet of going into the deep background checks that take anywhere from six to eight weeks to be done the committees have been formed and thats underway well early august i cant guarantee you august but it will be in early august before several weeks before the convention i believe yes yes and that depends look one of the things you try to do ive talked at length over the years with president obama about this you try to find people who have a background and an expertise that you may not have and so one of the reasons president obama picked me is because i had considerable experience in getting things done in the congress and secondly i had considerable experience in foreign policy and national security and although he had clear views of what in fact he wanted to do and what his standard what his strategy was in terms of americas role in the world he was looking for someone that had daytoday experience and knew a lot of those world leaders and so i think that although thats a helpful thing to have its not necessary because i start off with the two places i still have some expertise are in both those places in uniting the country and the congress and foreign policy and so it is almost all of the women im considering have had some exposure to foreign policy and national defense issues and security issues but that is not a minimum requirement requirement is that they have the intellectual capacity as well as the temperament as well as the leadership qualities that lend to everyone to believe that they would be ready on day one to be president of the united states of america with regard to whether or not the president it depends on exactly what he did and what he knew but at a minimum at a minimum he either does and what he knew but at a minimum at a minimum either doesnt understand his job and is having difficulty sitting down and being able to read a report because a', ' lot of those reports come across that he says i didnt read it or i didnt see it or i didnt know it i dont know how he could not read and not see and not know so many different things that have come up over the last three years but it is clearly a dereliction of duty and it is clearly something that i think everyone including my republican friends and my republican opponents in the house and senate are worried about as well thank you all right wheres the delaware state news i mean delaware news channel i should say thats my hometown team i better call on them how are you well i think theyve handled it pretty well so far but now i think youre seeing the make some adjustments because there has been an uptick not tremendous but theres been an uptick it was one of the states that was i get briefed up every day by a group of leading docs around the world around the country vic and dr ben anyway and so every day i get a printout i have it in the book here of the states that are doing better and doing worse up to now there has been a decline and now its opening up slightly i have not spoken to the today but my guess is id only guess is that hes going to be looking very closely what happens on the delaware beaches now how that has occurred and restaurants and bars i dont know enough to know that though the good news is that its flattened out the bad news is theres a slight uptick and i have not gone into the detail of the i speak to him not infrequently but a couple of times a month three four times a month and so i dont have any advice for him yet because i dont know where its popping up thank you im going to get in trouble fire away i know tell them ill be late just a little bit okay all right i always get in trouble on the last question but go ahead well i think the way to get on the same page is to im going to try to say this politely is to lower the rhetoric based on division stop appealing to the less healthy side of society instead of for example when a golf cart goes by yelling white supremacy and the president tweets it out dont do things like that bring the country together were giving a portion of the population who has responded to the sort of race baiting the president has engaged in a sort of free pass and it generates divisions and were also talking about it in terms of the president talks about manhood and being strong and you dont need the mask i think we have to start appealing to the better side of human nature by pointing out that that mask is not so much to protect me its if i have it its to protect you against me its to protect other people and its called patriotism its called responsibility its called making sure you look out for the other person and we have spent too much time if you notice the president puts everything in terms of him and im not being facetious everything is him its i dont think or i dont take responsibility or i didnt do that or i believe that i mean its not about i its about us and i think changing the tone of an administration across the board allowing scientists to speak making sure that people understand the facts good bad and indifferent and when a mistake is made to say i made a mistake i was wrong shouldnt have done it that way we should do it this way i think all those things change the atmosphere let me conclude it by saying this and i apologize youve hear', 'd me say this before the words of a president matter no matter who the president is no matter how responsible or irresponsible the president is a president whomever he or she is can take us to war or bring peace can have markets rise or fall appeal to the senior side of humanity or to our better angels it matters it really matters and so i think its about the tone and i think it goes across the board ill conclude with this i know that i was criticized legitimately criticized during the primaries by saying that i plan on uniting the country bringing democrats and republicans together we have to do that if we cant do that we cant function we have to bring the country together and i think on this piece if in fact we stand up and by the way dont hold me to the numbers please you can correct me on this but i think something like or or of the american people think you should wear a mask the overwhelming number of people think you should take these precautions and so on think we should open more slowly well i think that we should be talking to our better angels and actually making people indirectly feel guilty for not doing the right thing appeal to their better nature i know that sounds almost idealistic but its not remind people you dont wear this mask you end up hurting someone or you get infected you take it home to your child you can take it home to your mother and your father and your husband your wife you have a moral obligation because it really is it really is thank you guys i really do have to go i apologize im going to get in real trouble im probably already in trouble but thank you go ahead whats the last im sorry well i think its very different i think its better if theyre taken down like they took the confederate flag off the mississippi flag thats the better way of doing it but i can understand i can understand the anger and anguish that people feel by having for years and years been under the statue of robert e lee if youre an african american so its a difference its always better to do it peacefully but theres a distinction between i shift responsibility and i think the elected officials where those statues are have a responsibility to move put them in museums get them down but dont expect if you have sitting in front of you after all these years and we finally finally are going through another phase of maybe responding to the systemic racism in america and what weve seen happen is dont be surprised if someone pulls down the statue of jefferson davis its better that they do not but is fundamentally different than pulling down the statue or going to the lincoln memorial and trying to pull a not lincoln memorial thats a bad example the jefferson memorial and grabbing jefferson off his chair oh yes three yeah i commit to it look i am committed to following the debate the national debate group that sets up these debates who they pick as the moderators three of them its been this way for a long time the first one is a oneonone debate with a moderator the next one is led by a town meeting set and a third one is a normal debate again i commit to those im looking forward to them youre a lying dog ive been testing im constantly testing look all you got to do is watch me and i can hardly wait to compare my cognitive capability to the cognitive capability of the man im running against thank you so mu'], ['well good morning everyone because our safer at home or expires this friday july st at pm dr harris now here once again to provide an update to the current order as well as to what changes will take place going forward after my remarks dr harris will provide the latest covid numbers of alabama as well as where we are in our efforts to try to contain this disease by reducing its transmission treat it the best we can and hopefully get this virus behind us one day in our rear view mirror that day cant come too soon before we get to the updates today i think its only fitting that we make a few comments on the passing of a true alabama civil rights icon john lewis since his death so much has been written and said about congressman lewis itd be hard to add much more to his incredible story and his truly inspirational life but i for one was very pleased that our state led the nation in giving congressman lewis and appropriate and i t', 'hink a very fitting sendoff for a life well lived and a true example of service above self whether it was when his horse drawn carriage paused atop the edmund pettus bridge resting on the red rose petals that contrasted with his own blood that was shed some years ago or having our states troopers stand and salute as the congressman passed over the bridge for one final time alabamians came from all parts of the state to pay their final respects to this proud son of alabama native of troy we are grateful to the lord that we had him for as long as we did and our thoughts some prayers continue with him and his family and friends and all the lives that were touched because of john robert lewis may he rest in peace today with the support of dr harris im extending our current safer at home order until the end of august with a few minor modifications which ill explain in just a minute these decisions are not easy and theyre certainly ', 'not fun and theres no way in the world youre ever going to make everybody happy of the time but one thing is for sure tough decisions are a lot easier to make when youre on the sidelines than when you are actually in the arena now ive said many times since my very first press conference back when we were all still learning how to pronounce coronavirus that when youve been elected youve got to try to do the right thing not necessarily the most popular thing and there is such a fine balance as we have discussed countless times in factoring both the human health as well as economic health into the equation and as ive said before my administration and i have made our share of mistakes during this pandemic but our goal has always been to make more good decisions than bad hopefully leading to more positive results along the way as for todays new order this would include extending our statewide mask ordinance through august st and wh', 'ile no one enjoys wearing a mask id be the first to tell you that because of the help and support weve gotten from our friends in retail and business i believe we are making progress in this arena we just must remain vigilant if were going to get our kids back in school and keep our economy open and wearing a mask cant hurt but it sure can help and more and more people are seeing this for what it is a way to protect yourself as well as to protect the others that you work with come in contact with care about and those you even love and speaking of our schools i want to encourage every superintendent every principal every teacher and every parent whos listening we dont have the luxury of not getting our young people back in school while i respect those districts that have elected to go to virtual classrooms i feel with all my heart that a slide will come by to keeping our kids at home especially if there are other options and th', 'at slide is likely to have a dramatic negative impact on alabamas future our young people so heres a challenge to all of our school districts and each of our schools around the state nothing is set in concrete and if the covid situation in your community or counties permits you should be looking to phase back into in person classroom participation if at all possible now while a majority of safer at home order will remain the same theres one addition to this order that will impact those schools providing in class instruction they will now be required to wear a mask whenever practical from second grade through college we know that with all the responsibilities of being a teacher that this can be an added burden to require that a mask be worn but just as we have focused on creating a safe and healthy environment for our students its also important that we take care of our teachers as well other than our parents one of the most im', 'portant persons in a childs life is the teacher of that child and many of our students and their families rely on school for more than just classroom activities school is a safe place where many of our children get their healthiest meal of the day and where they are loved and encouraged as well as taught as a former school teacher myself and as president of the state school board im telling you we need to do everything we can to get our kids back in the classroom as soon as possible as dr harris makes his way up to the microphone let me again thank the people of alabama for your understanding for your patience for your support and your willingness to help us get through these difficult days dr harris dr harris actually alabamians have died dr harris i want to say thank you to for extending this order i think thats absolutely the right thing to do i fully support that im very aware that many people dont like the idea of having ', 'to wear a face covering and certainly i dont either and i know people dont like being told what to do and i dont either but i do believe that its the right thing to do i know early on dr harris so please let me ask all alabamians to continue to wear these ive been so encouraged to see so many people who are wearing these and who are following the rules that we would like for them to follow as we begin to move towards school reopenings its going to be more important than ever that people will be willing to wear face coverings if we want our schools to minimize the number of cases they have and minimize outbreaks and the risk of closing again we really need people to cooperate with continuing to wear face coverings its really more important now than ever we still have several months to go at least i think in this outbreak and we know well get through it on the other side eventually but we all need to work together and cooperate ', 'and pull together in order to do so thank you very much brian the bottom line is we just simply do not need to close our businesses if at all possible we need to keep our people being able to earn a good livelihood keep the economy going because without a good livelihood you cant have much of a life jen dr harris yeah i would say i dont really have a hard number in mind to serve as a trigger but its a consolation of a lot of things the numbers going up is certainly of concern but also it really matters how hospitals are able to handle that right now they are managing the handle that surge they have ways of creating that space internally they certainly always have the ability to limit the elective things done in hospitals that they need to create space weve talked to many of them about considering doing that we have continued to work with hospitals about the possibility of setting up alternate care sites as well which would be ', 'sort of pop up hospitals outside of the usual hospital setting yes sir well the purpose of the masked mandate was not to penalize people but to inform them of the urgency and the importance inaudible can help provide as we slow down this pandemic so were not worried about that and theres police chief down at spanish fort i believe thats using this as an opportunity to inform people and anybody who needs a mask he gives them so its a cooperative arrangement go ahead when everythings got to be done at the local level decisions made in that regard certainly we want our teachers to be safe as we do our workers at the schools and much less students so its a work in progress and we just got to use good common sense and for those schools that are going virtual say for the first nine weeks my message to them is to do all you can and when things began to improve it a little bit begin to phase back in other students and open up some of ', 'your attendance in the classroom in school yes sir dr harris yeah and they will take place absolutely the facilities have to be safe for kids to come back to school we actually are in the process of releasing a toolkit for not just reopening the physical building but how to bring kids safely back to school weve been developing in conjunction with the department of education and dr mackey it should be released later this week were doing a satellite broadcast webinar next week on tuesday i believe for all the superintendents around the state for school nurses and other school officials so well cover all those things but clearly those are going to have to be safe facilities to come back to speaker dr harris from a inaudible standpoint when you look at the mask mandates what would be your interpretation that inaudible speaker follow up to the questions contact me or the department of public health thank you so much thank yall so m'], ['good afternoon and happy friday with me is to my right is the woman who needs no introduction the commissioner of the department of health judy persichilli to her right another familiar face the department of healths disease service medical director dr ed lipchitz great to have you both to my left another guy who needs no introduction the superintendent of the state police colonel pat callahan director of the office of homeland security and preparedness jared maples is with us good afternoon first i want to wish everyone in our states wonderful extraordinary muslim community by the way the second largest muslim american community of any american state a blessed eid al adha the festival of sacrifice commemorating gods test of abraham and marking the end of the hajj the pilgrimage to mecca so to all eid mubarak next i must acknowledge sadly the announcement yesterday by the new jersey jewish news that it is ceasing print publication after an impressive year run serving new jersey the news was an important link that connected new jerseys diverse jewish communities and which strengthened the bond between our state and the one hand and the state of israel on the other and i want to give a shout out to our friend ambassador dani dayan his last day as israels console general in new york including service to new jersey is today and we wish him the very best and thank him for his extraordinary partnership over the past two and a half years during our time here the jewish news predates the creation of israel and has covered the news honestly and transparently across its nearly seven and a half decade run the news has fought against the increasing incidents of antisemitism and intolerance across our state when i took my first international economic mission as i made sure it included a stop in israel a key trading and business partner and as always the jewish news was there to cover it so to all the reporters and editors who over the years have put out the paper edition new jersey jewish news every shabbat thank you and i hope the news will continue in an online format you are all a vital part of a vital force for the good a vital voice and force for the good next i must note i would be remiss if i did not that senate republican leader mitch mcconnell sent the senate home for a long weekend without taking any action on a long list of items but especially to renew unemployment federal unemployment benefits that have now expired for millions of families here in new jersey and many more millions nationwide with millions of families literally left hanging to simply go home for a long weekend is the ultimate act of irresponsible behavior and dereliction of duty senator mcconnell please get back to washington and get this done families across our state and indeed across the nation are facing literally an economic meltdown on your watch and this is no time to take a weekend nevermind a long weekend off despicable now before we turn to the overnight numbers i am proud to announce that were making a series of improvements this is a inaudible chart pat to our online dashboard that will provide a deeper look into and provide greater context to judy is laughing as well the data that we discuss here every day we receive a summary from ed and his team at the communicable disease service which provides a detailed overview of cases and data pertaining to hospitalizations and deaths that data will now be put in a more interactive and easy to navigate form the dashboard available at covidnjgov will provide statewide and county level trends in covid confirmed cases deaths and hospitalizations over time we are posting the percent positivity by region and by date and the number of cases can now be viewed by the date of illness onset the breakdowns by race and ethnicity are given greater clarity and we are also posting the complete curve of confirmed cases by date of death as well as the dates of the deaths we currently have listed as probable throughout this pandemic we have occasionally made tweaks to the way we present data to provide greater context or clarity and todays upgrades to the dashboard continue that work and i must thank j', 'udy and ed and their teams for their ongoing efforts so if you go to the dashboard you will see that we are today reporting an additional positive test results pushing the total number of cases of coronavirus in new jersey since march th to before i move on id like to note that even with the increases we have seen in the latest case numbers new jersey remains among the ten states nationwide with the lowest number of active cases per capita i want to warn you in advance youre going to get on the one hand on the other hand today because the other hand were going to be pretty tough on it as well the positivity rate for tests recorded for july which is the latest day for which we had that data is that is also not quite as good as its been but thats pretty darn good we have continued to increase our volume of testing over the past couple of weeks and as a result we remain among the five states with the lowest daily percent positivity again one of the top ten cases in lowest number of active cases per capita and we remain among to repeat the five states with the lowest daily percent positivity i want to add that i had a good conversation with the executive chairman of bioreference this morning john cohen to talk through in particular how we can all work together as weve mentioned several times judy over the past few weeks to shrink that turnaround time its too uneven and for the most part its too long and we had a good call with john side by side with that we also continue ramping up our contact tracing capabilities and working with local health departments to identify causes of outbreaks that have contributed to recent increases in our cases and judy and i will have more on that next week both i would bet technologically but also an update here in person however the increases in new cases we have seen over the past week has pushed the statewide rate of transmission to and given the recent data on cases we anticipate unfortunately that it will go higher in the days ahead so heres on the other hand look the numbers are setting off alarms that we are taking and we take very seriously we still may be among the leaders in having the lower case numbers and daily positivity rates we dont take that for granted but we are standing in a very dangerous place as i said the alarms are going off the only way to silence these alarms and get back to the process of moving forward is for everyone to take them seriously not just most of you but all of you all of us we are not past this everyone who walks around refusing to wear a mask or who hosts an indoor house party or who over stuffs a boat is directly contributing to these increases this has to stop and it has to stop now as a reminder the limit on indoor gatherings is the lesser of either individuals or of capacity meaning if your capacity is say then you can have no more than people inside its the lesser of or individuals and i want to reiterate that i and we reserve the right to lower this threshold if necessary to protect public health im not anticipating or announcing i should say any specific action today but consider this as being put on notice we will not tolerate these devil may care nonchalant attitudes any longer pat is going to have a couple of specific comments on compliance and hes got one thing in particular that relates to indoors that he will hit hard and i will be happy to come in behind you and hit hard as well now back to the data and ill look at yesterdays report from our hospitals as of last night there were covid confirmed patients being treated with an additional judy persons under investigation pending the return of their test results thats a total of hospitalizations of those required intensive care and ventilators were in use overall the trends in our hospitals continue to move our healthcare system in the right direction and as these numbers keep moving down so do we in the national rankings and the important healthcare metrics sadly however we continue to lose members of our extraordinary new jersey family to covid and today we must report another ten confirmed deaths and losses of blessed lives of these judy you and i talked about this earlier', ' seven occurred in the past five days and three of those were on july the only day with more than one confirmed death of late this is a big deal and i know judy is going to want to come in behind this as well as of the latest hospital data there were no and i repeat no zero in hospital deaths reported over the hour period ending at pm last night that is the first day that we can say that that is the case since march th days ago almost five months ago and youve asked us folks will we get one of those days and we said wed get it we just didnt know when it was the hours that ended last night so i think were all going to just take a quick moment and reflect on that again the first day we can say that since march ten well this is an extraordinary milestone let me just remind folks and judy and ed correct me if you think im wrong about this im going to say about a month ago is about when you would have been plus or minus infected and i know theres some that were a lot longer and some that were shorter that would have led to a death around now if you look at the number of positives that we were reporting at the end of june as we are in the end of july it was averaging about a day there were a couple of days higher and there were a couple of days lower in that last week of june this past week the average eye balling it and again a big number today a somewhat lesser number yesterday lets smooth that out is averaging about so lets just remember deaths or lack of deaths thank god in this case reflect positive cases this is a lagging indicator of what we were seeing and again im simplifying about a month ago about a day of positive cases this past week a day of positive cases so not only do we commemorate reflect and celebrate zero deaths in our hospitals over the past hours we have to also acknowledge the number of positive cases is meaningfully higher right now on average than it was a month ago the total number of lost lives that are confirmed lab confirmed and the number of probable deaths remains at as we do every day lets recall three more of the blessed members of our new jersey family who we have lost we begin by remembering dominick on the left and shirley on the right dstefan of florham park which they called home for years dstefan their family walked me through this dominicks ancestors came from italy their name was in fact distefano but in the lost in translation reality of ellis island the eye behind the d got flipped into an apostrophe and the o at the end of distefano got dropped so they are dstefan the proudly italian americans dominick was born in the chambersburg section of trenton in the house by the way that his father a mason built by hand and i think it was his dad who was the one who came over and immigrated as first generation at the onset of world war ii dominick enlisted in the us navy and served as a radar technician aboard the light cruiser the uss wooster from that posting he developed a lifelong interest in electronics after the war he earned a degree in electrical engineering under the gi bill from temple university but his budding career in the field was short circuited when he was recalled to the navy to serve during the korean war after his second tour of duty dominick earned his masters in management sciences from the stevens institute of technology and began a career with bell labs where he would work on the telstar project the first successful transmission of a radio wave to a target in space and back but more importantly to a target in space and back but more importantly it was at bell labs that he met shirley upon his retirement from at he began a career teaching mathematics and engineering at the county college of morris retiring in his s dominic had a lifelong love of music and was an accomplished trumpeter and trombonist a member by the way of the musicians union he played in orchestras as well as in major parades his favorite song as was my late fathers favorite song was hoagy carmichaels american classic stardust im dating myself just one week after dominick passed shirley too lost her battle with covid shirley was born in carney attended carny high school and uppsala coll', 'ege and as we know now she also started working at bell labs after their marriage shirley and dominick by the way she called him dom they settled in florham park to raise their daughter donna shirley would go back to work as a school bus driver for the florham park board of education and became a beloved fixture in the life of the community and in the lives of the thousands of children she transported to and from school she knew where each one lived what their likes were and recalling something special about their personalities after hanging up her bus keys shirley took an active interest in gardening and birdwatching making the weekly trip to agway on senior citizens tuesday for various bird seeds and treats for her feathered friends she loved all animals and never minded when the neighborhood deer stopped by to snack on the seeds she put out she loved to sew and bake pies and to travel the world dominick and shirley were both longtime and active parishioners at grace episcopal church in madison for over years when they passed he was and she was they leave behind as i mentioned their daughter donna and her husband dennis and i had the honor to speak with both of them so as we send them off i want to quote hoagy carmichael and say though i dream in vain in my heart it will remain my stardust melody the memory of loves refrain may god bless them both we thank dominick for his years of service to our nation next we remember john kupcho on the left and look at his family on the right my lord of west caldwell jack as he was known was jack served in the us air force and earned a bachelor of science and ornamental horticulture from the university of tennessee then came to new jersey to earn his master of science and environmental science in urban planning from rutgers university he would have a long career at rutgers beginning in as the essex county agricultural agent at the rutgers cooperative extension helping commercial vegetable growers in bergen essex morris and passaic counties to maximize resources to increase crop yields jack would ultimately serve as chairman of the department of agricultural resource management agents at rutgers cook college jack developed the masters gardner program for northeastern new jersey he organized leaf composting and groundwater education programs and worked with the newark urban gardening program a program which was chosen for the take pride in america award in jack accepted that award from president ronald reagan at the white house for as more than half century of teaching advising and improving agriculture jack received the new jersey board of agricultures distinguished service to agriculture award he also held the title of professor emeritus at rutgers cook college in jack and his first wife maryanne who by the way sadly passed away at the very young age of they took over the pine florist in verona and he was often in the greenhouses giving advice to novice gardeners and veteran horticulturists alike jack was involved with many local groups including the west caldwell environmental commission which honored him last august by renaming the west caldwell community gardens in his honor horticulture was his professional love but jack took special pleasure in his family and you could see he had a big one especially being part of his grandchildrens lives he was also dont hold this against him or me a lifelong red sox fan an affliction which paid off late in life with their world championship runs jack is survived by his wife helen and shes not well either so please pray for her his daughters terry and i had the great honor of speaking with terry mary ellen kathy who by the way is a council woman in west caldwell coleen and their spouses and by his grandchildren we thank him for his many years of service to new jerseys farmers and gardeners hes a big reason why we still proudly call us the great garden state may god bless him his memory and his extraordinary family three more members of our new jersey family who covid has taken away three more reasons why we cannot let up one bit in doing all we can to stop the spread of this virus to save lives i reiterate what weve been sayin', 'g here all week and frankly for the past several weeks use your common sense we all want to get back to things the way they were but right now that is just not possible keep social distancing keep wearing a mask and please remember indoor parties are just a bad idea period now switching gears this morning the news broke that the census bureau will be ending its doortodoor efforts one month earlier than originally planned on september th meaning that we need you to make sure you are counted now we cannot overstate the importance of an accurate count of all new jerseyans in the census its about protecting billion every year in aid for our schools our health care facilities and our communities thats billion over a decade if youre counting at home its about making sure every family has healthy food to eat and that our roads and transit systems are funded its about making sure that we have what we need to rebound from this pandemic its about making sure we get back every dollar from washington that we deserve so far roughly two and a half million households or of all new jersey households have already responded to the census thats a good number but right now were only good enough to rank st among all states in responding we need everyone to be counted last weekend faith leaders took to their pulpits and asked their worshipers to fill out the census and by monday we saw our numbers going up so i want to thank those faith leaders each and every one of them and we ask you folks to continue engaging your congregations please take time to go to censusgov today to make sure you and your family are counted then reach out to your friends and neighbors and make sure they are too we know new jersey was under counted in and because of that we have lost out on literally billions and billions of dollars of extra federal funds over the past decade and the news that the census bureau will stop its direct outreach one month early means that unless you do your civic duty we will be counted again in an undercount will almost certainly mean especially that our communities of color will be left out there will be hundreds of activities across the state this weekend to push residents to get counted you could find one near you by the way going to censusnjgov censusnjgov communities across the state have challenged each other to see who can outperform the other lets all be a part of the census lets show how strong new jersey is by getting counted today again go to censusgov a couple of others items the last dance of the last dance is tonight right here in trenton at arm hammer park cranford against jackson cranford won the north jackson won the south it should be a barn burner hats off to each and every member of those teams and their managers and coaches but also to every single team who participated this as hard as covid is to deal with only two teams out of could not play out their entire string so to the organizers to the inspiration the folks who had the inspiration to this tournament and to each and every one of the participants hats off to each and every one of you now finally i want to continue to highlight the small businesses and business leaders who are not only such a strong of our communities but who will be a vital part of our longterm economic recovery we know this pandemic has been nothing short of an economic crisis as much as it has been a public health crisis and that is why i am proud of the work of the new jersey economic development authority to pump million directly into our small business sector one of those small businesses were proud to have partnered with is joys hallmark of marlton owned by ron and joy monokian theyve been in business since helping their customers celebrate holidays birthdays weddings graduations and frankly everything else in between but when the pandemic hit their store took a hit too through the eda ron was able to secure direct grant assistance which when paired with the support he received through the federal government meant the joys hallmarks employees could be kept on the payroll and that the bills could be paid to keep the store running i had the great pleasure of speaking with r', 'on on wednesday afternoon and i know he shares our optimism in the days ahead although he reminded me hes still off of where it was last year so while hes optimistic hes still making up for lost time hes also by the way a member of both the burlington and ocean city chambers of commerce and i share his support of all the small business owners who have been working hard to keep their dreams alive throughout this pandemic were going to get through this together and were going to come out stronger together that goes by the way not just for our small business community that goes for each and every one of our entire state lets keep working together to push this virus back down so i want to wish everybody a safe weekend again keep your social distances wear a mask and please no house parties no overstuffed boats we cannot afford any more irresponsible outbreaks weve also got some weather coming down the pike which pats going to talk about in a few minutes we could do this folks were new jersey we have never backed down from a fight and weve never lost we always punch above our weight we always get there unlike any american state we cannot let our hair down were not out of the woods this is not past us were seeing real evidence of that so folks stay together keep doing the right things behave responsibly common sense for the common good for yourself your family your neighbors your friends for all of us now it is my pleasure to turn things over to the woman who needs no introduction the commissioner of the department of health judi persichilli judith persichilli today we are further investing in the public health infrastructure by making million in federal funding available to county and local health departments million of the cdc funding will be allocated to health departments in each of the counties and the city of newark which are responsible for preparedness coordination in their jurisdictions these health departments are known as lincs agencies lincs stands for local information network and communications systems this funding will allow these agencies to hire additional employees to coordinate testing contact tracing and isolation and quarantine activities in their communities in collaboration with the local health departments these new positions will provide data management and epidemiological support to all local health departments and contact tracing teams within their areas theyll help individuals exposed to covid with the needs such as housing food mental health and medical services and other social supports and they will ensure testing contact tracing isolation and quarantine and social support services are conducted in a timely and complete manner judith persichilli previously healthy young individuals to years of age werent back to usual health in two to three weeks after testing positive this lingering illness may lead to prolonged absences from work studies or other activities so researchers are beginning to study the longer term effects of covid and some studies have indicated that the virus can damage the heart in addition there are many anecdotal stories of individuals that had the illness who are still struggling with fatigue and difficulty breathing months later this should be a sobering reminder to healthy residents especially young individuals that this disease is serious you could be battling cough fatigue or shortness of breath for weeks or months again there are still a lot we dont know about the disease and its health effects so it is not worth taking unnecessary risks we must continue to take precautions staying a safe distance from others wearing face coverings and practicing good hand hygiene judith persichilli our daily percent positivity as of july in the state is the northern part of the state reports the central part of the state and the southern part of the state as the announced we are adding additional data to our dashboard i want to thank ed he is the developer of the dashboard to provide more context about how covid unfolded in our state and our counties under the tab titled case summary you can view the trends the mentioned you can also select individual dates and date rang', 'es to see the data more granularly we are adding data on age adjusted case and mortality rates by race and ethnicity which allows for a fair comparison between the groups with different age distributions and earlier this week we posted a new tab with hospital discharge data broken down by age gender race and ethnicity that concludes my daily report as always stay connected stay safe stay healthy get tested mask up and for each other and for us all please take the call thank you judy great report and thank you for everything i have begun to get read in more recently more anecdotal than science based a friend bill leferett up in mahwah first raised with me a number of weeks ago this whole notion of what theyre now calling long haulers as in long haul truckers but this reality of the lingering health challenges i mentioned the red sox earlier theyve got a pitcher right now whos got an inflamed heart muscle in his heart but he tested negative now after having tested positive weeks ago theres fatigue you mentioned whole range of challenges many of which we probably dont know yet to your very good point that creates another health challenge that were going to have to collectively deal with obviously because were going to be there for those people but its another reminder that once you get sucked in by this it could linger in your system in your body for a long time so the consequences may god forbid are not life and death but as weve seen with thousands and thousands of folks who have lost their lives it is an addition to that you may get through this as most people do but you may bring with you health realities that could go on for a long time so thank you for highlighting that pat tropical storm is on our list which is not covid but thats something that would potentially complicate our lives compliance again you and i are not happy with indoor behavior any update on that front and any other matters pat at two oclock if were done by two i will be on with the national weather service and if not emergency management command will be on and then at three oclock this afternoon i will be on with region two administrator tom vanessan and his staff again pointing to our phenomenal partnership with fema making sure that were ready should this tropical storm evolve into a hurricane at this juncture were thinking hopefully its going to be mostly a rain event similar to tropical storm fay but in emergency management we always say you can never be over prepared so thats all i got gov pat could you repeat just for a second and make sure everyone hears this what the diner was cited for this is indoor okay i mean we couldnt be clearer every single darn day its quite clear what works and what doesnt work and i will tell you this anecdotal evidence that weve heard of other behavior like that and as i said i mentioned were putting up the alarms and the flashing lights right now whether its enforcement or changing our policy you should assume were not going to sit and take this much longer on the storm plus or minus when does that hit new jersey based on what you know and i know youve got your call still ahead of you i know i speak on behalf of judy ed jared the rest of us if you have to go to take the call were better off for it we wont be offended so thank you thank you all i think well start over here were going to be a virtual tomorrow and sunday and were one oclock on monday we just got where the white house is going to be at like four oclock or three oclock i think on monday so well be able to hold our regular times and we also reserve the right to revisit this three a week format if things go south youll see more of us but hopefully that wont happen again virtual tomorrow and sunday unless you hear otherwise and well be together with you in person at one on monday aswans got the mic dustin good afternoon dustin do you still stand by the billion figure for projected losses or do you plan to revise that figure given some of the fears and anxieties that teachers and faculty have about returning to school in the fall would you be willing to allow teachers and school workers the option of working remotely as you gave that opti', 'on to parents for their children and lastly on the eviction moratorium obviously tenants are struggling to pay their rent but then on the flip side you have a lot of landlords who havent collected rent in six months do you have any timeline for ending the moratorium or do you have any plans to address that issue thanks thank you dustin i have to say based on what we know the outside reality is not our problem at the moment and judy unless you would see it otherwise we dont have evidence and again theres a mountain of data that were plowing through all the time we just have not seen the evidence that the outside reality is our problem it is the inside reality and that is something that we are its no secret at this point because as ive said it several times that is something were looking hard at i dont have an update on the billion number dustin but thats something that were going to continue to look at and boy i wish we had resolution on the federal cash assistance for states not only did they walk away off the bridge of the ship in the senate leaving individuals hanging who are barely hanging on by a thread but youve got states all over the country that are barely hanging on by a thread i think on the educators side by the way we had a good meeting with some of the leadership and the educators our team and their team yesterday and the districts are in the last stages of putting their plans together i think well leave that to the district plans and see what they have and what they are actually planning as weve said many times no two districts are alike but one of the asks a rightful ask of educators has been capacity in the classroom and one of the ways that we wanted to give relief not just to parents to give them flexibility and kids at districts but also as explicitly to educators and that task was to give that remote learning flexibility and option particularly when we found the resources to close the digital divide and so that is indirectly not just helping the family and kids where that makes sense but its also helping the educators by lowering capacity yeah i asked the last night the moratorium matt plackin is with us i think will last up to as i recall two months after i declare an end to the health emergency number one and number two symmetry has been at the core of a lot of the rental and mortgage holidays and windows that weve created in other words if youre a landlord with a mortgage over here would ask the mortgage bankers to get off your back and give you a holiday and likewise that allows you to give the people who are renting from you whether its a house or an office or whatever it might be a holiday on that side and that symmetry is still at the center of all of the windows that weve created what we dont want i was asked this last night people playing games and going circuitous only through one legal avenue when they know that that has a higher chance of being able to circuit our executive order or secondly that on day one following the end of the window whether youre a renter or you have a mortgage or youre a mortgage payer we dont want and dont expect that youre going to have a lump sum payment to make on day one of that post holiday period were working with the legislature matt unless im mistaken we need statutory authority so we need laws to be passed and were working with them so that theres a plan that more than asking or hoping that the mortgage lender or the landlord would behave that way there is something like for every month that youve had a window of you havent had to pay your mortgage you have a six month window to make that up something like that anything you want to add or are you good window to make that up something like that anything you want to add or are you good youre good thanks inaudible please is that it i havent personally spent a whole lot of time on this but we know the issue and our team is working with as i said theres legislative fixes that would partially if not entirely address that theres also behavior that we expect out of folks but we understand that this is a challenge ive got it by the way in my own family and so thats something that is a work in progr', 'ess i dont know matt if you want to add anything or you so bear with us on that but thats part of the legislative fix that were trying to get to youve got anything sir alex are you good that would be a conversation i could have with myself because i am a parent of a kid going back to school gyms full bore opening i dont its just not were not there yet limited and when we do get there your question i think was could you see it being done with some limitations capacity or otherwise yes just as indoor dining i think i dont want to put words in your mouth but weve talked for weeks now about having indoor dining all the capacity restrictions social distancing hyper hygiene and liquors bar service only to the table as opposed to any gathering around the bar so yes the answer is when we do get there on gyms and i say when well get there well get there on indoor dining it will be with some restrictions we do schedule we allow scheduled right now but only for either individuals or people in the same bubble which is overwhelmingly people in the same family or who are living under the same roof and i hope believe me that we get to a better place what are we looking at in terms of judy im going to hit this and then see if youre want to add anything where whats a red line that we might be at which would trigger potential policy or enforcement steps i think you should assume were there so i dont think we have to you wont have to wait a lot longer unless we see we better have a big weekend that would really help but assuming that the trends of late keep going where theyre going were in that neighborhood right now i cant tell you exactly what but overwhelmingly were focused on indoor really its two things right indoor activity and judy and all that she has done and all that were trying to do to manage outofstate travel coming in here in new jersey and those who have gone outofstate coming back in here we frankly dont see a whole lot coming from that second reality its were still getting our arms around that because were asking a lot of individuals it is overwhelmingly though indoor activity high congregation lack of ventilation what i would say as a parent or to a parent and i am a parent is a couple of things ive already said but i want to repeat because its a very good question dont expect a normal school year and i think if youve got that expectation youre going to be disappointed this is going to be unusual just look at the moment that were in not just as a state but as a nation and the world its not going to be normal secondly we will try to get as much flexibility as humanly possible into the system including reserving the right based on the data that weve just discussed to make decisions iteratively as we go forward thirdly remember that we have three big principles number one health number two best education possible number three equity and that gets to a point it depends on who the parent is is it a home with an extra room for the kid to easily remote learn multiple devices not both parents arent working so they dont have to worry about putting their living at risk or the daycare challenges that would come from having a child at home remember that on the other hand there are households whether its there are two working parents or a single mom or dad or the circumstances of their density of their living where the inperson option is the only option that theres really any plan b is a poor either doesnt exist or its a poor substitute for the inperson piece and i would say lastly that we will do it working with the districts and theyve done an extraordinary job well do it as responsibly as possible so that if youre in the school youre going to see social distancing enforced face masks and coverings enforced hyper hygiene limitations on capacity however they get there in that district it depends on the district because as ive said theres no two districts alike but know that normalcy is not within our grasp right now lets all accept that lets take our hats off to everybody the districts the supers the boards the educators the parents the kids themselves the staff that are all trying to get this right know that well do', ' it as responsibly as humanly possible and were going to go through this together thank you katherine is that you how are you good its hard to see people these days how are you i dont have a specific answer for the number on the second one but we can get it for you inaudible will you follow up with katherine i assume it is of million which is the number of people who have made a claim so whatever the of that number would be is around sounds to me like around but thats well come back to you and by the way i had asked the last night you all have been very good about raising issues that are overwhelmingly specific to the individual early on there were there was a weekend when the system crashed and that held us back a couple of days thats overwhelmingly not the case these days its very specific to the individual i think if we take any steps were not going to wait a whole lot longer i cant give you an exact date and again if we have a really good weekend and start to the week then well reconsider that but we whether its the policies in place the enforcement and the teeth with which although weve got a fair amount of teeth theres no question about that but were looking at it real time thank you for that good to see you matt is that it i dont think we have any that we know out of the jackson house party yet is that correct folks ed and i think you mentioned this earlier one of the two of us did judy that means were almost certain would be shocked if there werent cases sadly that came out of that so the numbers if anything are going up but i dont believe that theyre involved in that when was the last day we were at this number of positives rate a transmission i dont know but well get that for you matt did you hear that last day we were at where we are today which is i wont comment on a district plan not that im afraid to comment on it but i need to know a lot more about what the districts look like their rationale and i know the department of education would be forget about me the department of education who are the education experts and judy and her team as the health experts would want to look at that and understand our team had a very constructive meeting and i was back and forth with leadership myself with one of the big unions and listen i think everyone is trying to do the get to the right place here and i commend the fact that everyone is doing that and whether or not were exactly in the right place right now is a lot less of concerning or interest to me than is there a spirit of cooperation and teamwork trying to get to the right place recognizing as i said to alex earlier this is not a normal and it wont be a normal school year so bear with us on that again this is the districts are polishing off their plans and both department of ed department of health and our team on the front office will be going through that process quick swig im going to mask up judy if thats all right with you again judy and ed thank you pat likewise good luck on your calls i think we got you in just a couple of minutes before jared matt inaudible inaudible thank you all virtually or electronically tomorrow and sunday in person at one oclock on monday unless we say otherwise folks please weve done an extraordinary job as a state but the game is not over there is still time on the clock i wish we could tell you how much time there is on the clock but were not out of the woods and if you have any doubt look at whats going through going on in other states never mind a resurgence of positive cases in our state we have to repeat again judy it is a big day notwithstanding the increase in cases that for the first time in days we had no deaths in our hospitals and that cannot be understated or underestimated again as important as that milestone is its a lagging indicator of people who are getting infected plus or minus many weeks ago but folks keep doing a great job please cut out the indoor gatherings where people are on top of each other not socially distanced not wearing face coverings thats not going to work thats going to get us in more and more trouble as a state and will risk peoples health and lives thank you everybody god bless'], ['well good afternoon i want to thank broward health for hosting us before i begin i want to thank the emergency management personnel throughout the state of florida they prepared for isaias and we did not get the major impact that we were prepared for which is a very good thing but we did get a good trial run for what will likely be a busy hurricane season in particular we had the opportunity to beta test the new sheltering strategy which we had to evolve in light of the coronavirus the state of florida sent ppe kits and thermometers to all shelters in the storms path and arranged for noncongregate sheltering options for people who either had or were suspected of having covid and it all proved to be very helpful in palm beach for example we had people show up to a shelter that had tested positive recently or who did not pass the temperature screening and those people redirected to a nearby hotel where they had a safe place to stay until the storm passed i would just tell floridians theres been a lot of activity up to this point in the season we do anticipate more storms developing so make sure that you have a plan well hope for the best on this but we absolutely need to be prepared for more storms im really glad to be here with broward health we have gino santorio the president ceo we have josh lenchus doctorchief medical officer cheryl wild chief nursing officer and dave lacknauth executive director of pharmacy services for broward health theyre going to talk about some of the things that weve been working on in conjunction with them i think that theyve done a really good job i think everyone throughout south florida has done a fantastic job frontline healthcare workers in the hospitals in responding to this crisis we are looking at im going to make an announcement today about testing which i think will be helpful but we are encouraged by some of the trends were seeing we continue to see a downward trend in visits to the emergency department with people with covidlike illnesses weve seen a peak in covid positive patients that are hospitalized statewide happened the third week in july weve continued to see that census decline and i think that that is consistent with what theyve seen here at broward health today we reported one of the lowest numbers of tests that weve positive tests that weve reported in a long time and weve had two days in a row where the positivity has been which we were there for a while these are encouraging trends obviously theres a lot more work to do and one of the reasons why were here today is because we want to addres', 's the remaining challenges one is the turnaround time for testing when we started going to expand testing in may we thought that if we could get up to tests a day that that would really really be doing well remember in march and april we were doing tests a day there obviously was a need for more capacity so we worked to do that we have done a lot more than just we typically will get in roughly test results in a given day you are also seeing more and more testing throughout the country the result of that has been turnaround times of a lot of the commercial labs have just been moved to the right more and more you have longer wait times obviously if youre somebody that is symptomatic and if you dont get your results back for seven days that is not helpful for our asymptomatic test takers if it takes seven days then the test is basically useless at that time because even if you were infectious at the minute you tested by the time you get it back you probably havent been isolating anyways and youre likely to not be infectious on the backend of that so increasing the times is something that were looking to i asked jared moskowitz to make some changes to try to do that so starting tomorrow were going to have some real positive changes were actually going to convert two of our sites in miamidade county the marlins stadium and hard rock stadium to exclusively minute antigen tests the tests will be for people that have symptoms or for elderly and older there will still be a lane for the traditional testing for the other asymptomatic people but that will be the traditional swab with the traditional lab but for those folks who are older or who are symptomatic or both youre going to be able to go in get the antigen tests and in minutes walk out with a result thats not only good for the test taker and the patient its also good for officials monitoring the trends when we get tests reported to the state sometimes those tests were taken days before certainly the infections in many cases happened to days before so if youre looking at things like the positivity rate or some of these other things a lot of times that data can be stale now were going to get every day at these two sites total of tests were going to be able to get realtime data about the percent testing positive the number of people testing and so i think it will be really really good people want to know and want those results back what every other drive through site throughout the state of florida we are going to have symptomatic lanes this will be people that are experiencing coronavirus symptoms ', 'or are or both and they will be able to selfswab so they selfswab we have relationships with certain labs that once we get them the swabs we usually get a hour turnaround from the time the lab receives it so if we can get it to them as quick as possible they typically turn it around well this will be i think very good so its not going to be seven days which is whats been happening so hopefully it will be more of a to hour window which i think is a big deal when youre talking about this and of course there will be a lane for people who are asymptomatic were also going to offer at all these sites antibody testing and its something to think about because think weve seen with more of the research and the data thats come out particularly over the last few weeks cdc has now moved to a symptoms based approach for employees going back to work theyre discouraging needing to get a negative pcr test and i think part of the reason that the antibody test may make sense for people that dont have symptoms is pcr tests can pick up dead virus cdc says up to weeks but certainly we know people who have tested positive for days and days beyond the day period thats not an uncommon thing so if youre asymptomatic and youre testing we really cant tell you for sure whether you have live virus once we get those results now some people may still want to do pcr its going to be there but the antibody tests well be able to tell you whether you have the antibodies and whether you have been infected and if you have igm antibodies then you likely had a more recent infection if you have igg antibodies likely were infected a little bit further back in the past so thats very valuable information for people to know whether they have the antibodies and what weve seen is since we opened up antibody testing to the general public we used to do it for the healthcare workers and for the first responders weve opened it up weve seen the antibody rates increase throughout florida and some days well of the test takers will be positive for antibodies now its not scientifically representative because its just first come first serve but i think that theres a surprising amount of antibodies out there so if folks want to do that were going to be able to do it but its all about lab prioritization understanding that there is a limited lab capacity for a quick turnaround and if we can focus on those people who really need the test results the quickest i think were going to be able to improve so youre going to have two sites with instant tests and then youre going to have the other drive through s', 'ites with the self its with instant tests and then youre going to have the other drive through sites with the self swab and quicker turnaround at the lab option which im really excited about were also working very closely with all the hospitals throughout the state of florida as we look down with this coronavirus crisis the two things that i think were just so important to get right were doing everything we could to protect the vulnerable particularly those in longterm care facilities but then be there to support our frontline healthcare workers and our hospital systems remember when we did the whole flatten the curve in march and april that was all just to buy time to be able to make sure that the hospital system could cope with the pandemic and weve worked really hard with all the hospitals as theyve had needs weve worked really hard to respond with any assistance we can buy so for example with this remdesivir which is one of the top therapeutics that doctors are now offering weve gotten cases delivered to the state of florida which is vials and as hospitals ran low we had to go to the white house and get the schedule expedited and be able to get more remdesivir in the hands of our frontline physicians i think broward health they were going low and then they got replenished before they ran out and thats what we were trying to do were also promoting convalescent plasma donations hospitals do need this its high demand it can be an effective treatment and so were going to continue to encourage people throughout the state of florida to give blood if you do have the antibodies if youve recovered from an infection to go give the blood thats one of the reasons having the antibody lanes at these test sites are good because if you do test positive you can go get blood and you can help potentially save a life its very very important were also helping hospitals with personnel when the pandemic really got hot and heavy in march the fear that was put out was about running out of hospital beds that never was really a threat in the state of florida in march april may but then as we got into and started seeing the prevalence increase admissions we reached out to hospitals and said what do you need hows your day bed capacity and actually to a man they all said the bedroom is great we just need to make sure should we have enough personnel to staff the beds that we have and sure enough thats been the case weve had bed capacity the whole time certain areas of the state because of the increased admissions those frontline workers work extremely extremely hard pa', 'rticularly in dade and broward and so we were able to send medical personnel to hospitals we have more at my direction that can be deployed of the personnel are working right here at broward health so these are personnel that we didnt necessarily use in march and april may and the beginning of june but we had the arrangements in place so that if we needed to do it we could do it and i think that thats been a huge huge source of help i mean the amount of just their lives that theyve had the juggle if youre a frontline healthcare worker throughout the whole time has been tough but particularly once we saw the increase in prevalence at the end of june throughout july its been very very difficult and so to be able to provide some level of support there i think that thats a very good use of resources and im glad we were able to do it and finally i think were supporting the hospitals protecting the vulnerable we have now established covid exclusive nursing facilities throughout the state thats over beds and in broward we have three covid exclusive facilities throughout the state or throughout the county with a total of nearly beds and what that allows you to do one it allows you to limit an outbreak in a nursing home if someone tests positive they can be safely transferred to a covid only physical it also allows a hospital if they have a longterm care resident whos medically stable they know they cant discharge a sick patient back to the new nursing home because that would obviously create risk of spread but they can discharge to a covid exclusive facility so it helps prevent outbreaks in nursing homes or limit outbreaks in nursing homes and then it also helps the hospitals be able to manage their beds and if they have patients in there who dont require hospitalization if it is an infected nursing home resident theres a safe place to transfer where youre not going to run the risk of furthering the spread so we really appreciate the facilities here in broward stepping up to do this and the hospitals i think have worked really well with our secretary mary mayhew and i think its really been successful we have beds almost there are over but we have probably hundreds of more that are going to be online so i want to thank all the healthcare workers throughout the state that have been working tirelessly to support your fellow floridians in a very difficult time we appreciate the sacrifice were going to continue to support and remember there are certain things that all floridians can do look out for our vulnerable population make sure youre exercising good', ' hygiene exercising appropriate physical distancing such as avoiding crowded spaces closed areas and close contact and then wearing a facial cover particularly if you cant maintain that six footed difference floridians have really stepped up to the plate and done a great job as i said got a lot of work to do trends are a lot better today than they were a month ago so we want to build on that success and if we do it with one goal as one florida im confident were going to be able to get that done so its an honor for me to be able to introduce our ceo gino santorio from broward health so gino gino santorio in addition to the state effectively getting us some of the necessary drugs that have made a significant impact in the survivability such as remdesivir theyve also helped us in an area that is a significant need across the state which was staffing we currently in our system have employees that are a combination of respiratory therapists nurses and certified nursing assistants which have been able to help supplement our own staff to be able to ensure that we can effectuate a surge above and beyond what current numbers are today should we have needed them we would never as a safety net hospital turn away a patient safety nets in the state of florida represent about of the hospitals yet weve treated over of the covid hospitalized patients and a lot of the resources that enable us to do that have come not just from the state and internally but have come at a very rapid turnaround gino santorio inaudible nursing facilities have had testing of both the residents and the caregivers on a consistent basis you heard the speak about our covid only facilities that have been stood up that has been an absolute huge success factor in survivability of covid and maintaining a low mortality rate so very pleased to report that i do want to encourage and weve joined our hospital partners as well as additional healthcare partners in south florida to come together we launched a campaign called caringforsouthfloridaorg that encourages and really follows suit with the one florida campaign from the governors office to really encourage and maintain the diligence around social responsibility social distancing masking et cetera inaudible dave lacknauth they are on call for us night day weekends anytime they are there for us our infectious disease physicians as well same thing they are on call theyre on board theyre working with us to drive what i call that clinical bus in making sure we have the right therapies for supportive care around covid the care that we provide fo', 'r covid for our patients that are hospitalized is critical and important in this day and age what we find out is the one thing we understand is everything changes every day data comes out tomorrow that we didnt see today data is going to come out in two weeks that we dont know from tomorrow dave lacknauth they were able to ensure we got what we needed when we needed it to ensure our patients had the supplies and medication portfolio that they would need for our clinicians to then administer care again i just want to keep it brief with an overview of what were doing clinically to support our patients that come into broward health if you do come into broward health for covid or noncovid issues our clinical teams are here to support you and you will receive the best care that we can possibly give to you with the most up to date information im going to hand over now to dr lunches hes our chief medical officer for broward health medical center to expand on a little bit more dr lunches the patients outcomes of course are predicated on our knowledge of the ever evolving landscape of covid as you heard dave lacknauth talk about we do use things like remdesivir convalescent plasma is used so long as we can get it and youve heard really what we need the most though is for the community to help us help them and the way that they could do that is by adhering to the pivotal components of the governors platform where we protect the vulnerable where you wear your mask where you do hand hygiene and where you physically distance cheryl wilde i am cheryl wilde i represent nursing for the facilities in broward health i would just like to say that i very much support what my clinical partners have just said the care that were giving the patients is amazing the caregivers i cannot stand here without thanking them the caregivers the nursing teams the respiratory therapists everyone whos come out to really give everything that they have this last five months or so has been very challenging for them i cannot thank the and the state enough for the support that theyve given us the staffing and the nursing who have really just come out and help to support our system the care that were giving our patients again is top rate our outcomes have been very very good and im just very very thankful for all the support that we have received from the state at this point well thanks so much we really appreciate all the hard work i think the average member of the public understands that people in health care often have to work hard and i think that they assume that in a situation l', 'ike that thats even doubly but dealing with an infectious disease like this really is labor intensive because even if you guys have someone in a car accident they swab positive youve got to do all kinds of procedures to isolate to make sure that youre keeping it from spreading throughout your facility it requires a lot of folks to work a lot of hours work very hard obviously you have ppe and everything but none of that is foolproof so people are potentially exposing themselves as patients come in although i think the track record has been really good with our healthcare workers in terms of using that equipment its been a real challenge and i think that the folks really have stepped up done a great job we are happy to be able to provide some support and were going to continue to keep that support going for as long as you need it im encouraged about your trends i think that thats a really good sign we look at all these different things this number of tests or that but some of that is based on how many people youre testing whats your testing criteria when are the labs reporting all this but the people showing up at the emergency department or the people that are being admitted or discharged here thats just the reality of what the disease is doing and i think the fact that theyre either discharging people theyre generating a lot of positive outcomes compared to what you would have seen in february and march either in the united states or in other parts of the world thats really really encouraging and were obviously excited to be able to provide remdesivir work with the white house to do that and as other things come down the pike we want to continue to be helpful but we are here to help south florida we really appreciate its been a challenge for the whole state dont get me wrong the first kind of time we had south florida and then the rest of the state was relatively modest in terms of the prevalence this time i think everyone saw more prevalence but of course here in broward and miamidade youve seen the most and so i really appreciate how great everyones responded youve seen the most and so i really appreciate how great everyones responded with that im happy to take a question or two yes maam i got tested like two days ago so im not sure when that would have happened or whatnot so im tested regularly and i dont have or have not had any symptoms so the number of times ive been tested has been pretty significant and ive had my temperature checked probably a hundred times just in the last few months yes maam is that glenna oh hi this is for the lon', 'gterm care isolation centers okay yep well a couple of things one is the family should be notified if a family member is transferred to an isolation center i thought that that was being done but im going to look to see because they need to obviously if theres a positive case the nursing homes are required to notify the families with that but they should also do that so these isolation centers are following all the cdc guidelines they have negative pressure they have to be able to do that in order to get approved by ahca so as long as theyre following those rules its going to be safe and if somebody is covidpositive and is put there they are not allowed to be mixed if you do have a situation like that with the general population of course not that would defeat the whole purpose of doing the transfer in the first place because if were going to do that we could have just left them in the nursing facilities the nursing facilities we do have many just regular nursing facilities that have the ability to isolate we have plus most of them dont have that ability some do so if you have the ability to isolate and you have a positive test or two you can isolate the residents appropriately and obviously not allow that to get into the general public but for those which are the majority who do not have the capability of isolating theyre required to be transferred to a place that can be safely isolated sometimes thats hospitals and when we were in april and may we would see a lot of transfers but when the patient is not requiring hospitalization to have a covidonly nursing facility where they can safely isolate convalesce and then be discharged safely back is a really good tool but i think the families they need to be kept apprised on that so im going to talk to secretary mayhew and make sure that thats the case believe me thered be no reason to transfer anyone unless it was necessary for safety but i think as we found that when you have these outbreaks that run unchecked in a nursing facility you are going to see major clinical consequences for that in terms of hospitalizations and unfortunately in terms of a longterm care facility resident deaths yes sir so i havent talked to the white house but ive tried to say from the beginning well certainly over the last few months when it became apparent the number one source of outbreaks is in the home and so that becomes a specific challenge my house my wife and i i got young kids were not in the risk categories but youve got a lot of families in florida where youll have multi generational living or even if theyre ', 'not under the same roof particularly you look like a county like miamidade you just have a lot of family that live in the area and theyre getting together theyre doing what normal families do the risk and either if youre under the same roof the whole time or if youre in close contact is that those more vulnerable relatives whether its a parent a grandparent an uncle they then can be exposed by younger people who may not be visibly demonstrating symptoms and so i think its something that people should absolutely look at whether its the mask whether its isolation i think theres a lot of different ways but just to understand protecting our vulnerable part of that is if youre in those vulnerable groups you need to do what you can do to avoid crowds to protect yourself but everyone else also has a responsibility to govern themselves accordingly where theyre not providing any type of a danger to them but i would also say though the physical distancing avoiding the close contact in an enclosed environment that should not be put aside so youre going to do the mask in addition to that but just understand if youre in very close sustained contact particularly with some of those cloth masks you dont have a hundred percent protection of the droplets youre talking about it will intercept hopefully some hopefully most but certainly not all so people shouldnt have a false sense of security on that you still got to do the sanitation you still got to do the physical distancing so in terms of the education our primary policy is that parents should have a choice if they want to do distance learning because they dont want inperson instruction right now they should have the ability to do that but then for the many parents who really do believe that their kids need to be in the classroom we want that choice as well the department of education is working in conjunction with the department of health with districts on a districtbydistrict basis and they are also working with their local county health departments to be able to devise the best safety plans i think that theres a number of things that they may have in common but i also think that a plan in miamidade may look a little bit different than some of the other counties which may be more rural and may have less prevalence but id also say that we are happy to see singledigit positivity statewide for two days in a row we had been mired in we did have it go down to and then to see this decline i hope that that trend continues i think people have really been doing their part to make sure that it does thanks everybody']]\n"
